__label__2 Gossip Girl season 3: arrived a lot quicker than expected and was in condition that was stated. Thanks and I would buy from again!
__label__1 " Gossip Girl Boring: I dont get it,this is yet another show of wasted film.What is going on, rich kids, blah.INSTANT STAR on CTV Programming is not.Check INSTANT STAR out on the youtube.If you dont know about INSTANT STAR or Tommy & Jude maybe you should."
__label__1 " Never received my item: I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. They took my money and I still have received my item, money back, or feedback after emailing them nearly two weeks ago. I'm not ordering from them again."
__label__2 " Pretty good: I'm a coming-of-age genre fan, so Gossip Girl is right up my alley. The season started a little slowly, but it picked up pace toward the end. Mostly it was the same-old, same-old, just with grown-up clothing and with more serious consequences for actions. Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3."
__label__1 " The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show.: Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show. Seriously, how many times can Chuck and Blair get back together or a better question would be why s Michelle Tratchenberg returning at the end of every season?"
__label__2 " RUh-Ruh-Ruh-roofis!!!!: Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!"
__label__1 Very disappointed: I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
__label__1 " UNDELIVERY: I've already complained twice because I've bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I've never received it. As I've never got a answer, I'm writting this comment. WhAT shoud I do? I'm waiting for so many months and no answer and no product"
__label__1 Don't use this company never got item: This company sucks. It's been a lil over a month and never received item. I never got response back from the company after I emailed the 4+ times. I'm also dissatisfied with Amazon and will never use them as well. All I've gotten is the run around. I want my money back so I can go on my way
__label__2 " Love GG: I'm a big Gossip Girl fan and thought season 3 was great! Loved seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6! 4 and 5 were okay. ;)"
__label__2 " A change in attitude: For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Through this book I realized a good astrology reading is made up of the astrologer, the client, and astrology concepts. Astrology can not be tested or practiced as the machine of destiny: if you have X in Y you will be such and such."
__label__1 " Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
__label__1 Not Good Enough: I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well.
__label__1 " The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
__label__2 Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags.: I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
__label__1 " Not Worth the Trouble: You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest."
__label__1 Tuner doesn't work well after 1 yr.: I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.
__label__1 " This card is terrible: I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it."
__label__2 " Exelente eleccion: Los mejores zapatos de futbol que he comprado en mi vida, funcionan perfecto para cesped artifical, cesped natural y piso duro.Lo recomiendo 100%"
__label__1 " Poor Quality: I bought several of these for my daughters hoping that they would be like the one that I have used for the past 40 years. The design is the same, but the quality was terrible....way to flimsy, they didn't hold their shape (spring) for more than 5 minutes of use. I am greatly disappointed."
__label__2 " One of a kind: This is the most detailed bobble head I've ever seen. Its heavy, sturdy, all handpainted clothing, inscriptions on each pant leg, straight thizzface. I got one of the new Andre Macassi bobble heads and its a piece of crap compared to this one, which is why I'm guessing the Thizzelle Washington one was a limited edition of only 5000 handmade. Bummed these are sold out now, I need another one for my gameroom!!"
__label__1 " Terrible single: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
__label__2 Wonderful work by a lesser known composer: Edward German's music evokes images of idyllic days in the English countryside. His works are not as well known as those of other English composers from the early 20th Century but you won't be disappointed if you are looking for music that raises the spirit and soothes the soul.
__label__2 " great book: i was having trouble in school and my mom gave me this book. it saved me, it is easy to read and really makes sense. i'd reccomend it to anyone having any trouble at all in high school"
__label__1 " Conventional Wisdom for Morons: This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
__label__2 Excellent: I found this book as well as Vaultreports very helpful for anyone hoping to succeed at shifting jobs or careers.
__label__2 Rites of Passage: For great advice on what to expect when you work with a executive recuiter read chapters 7-10. Its worth the price of the book alone. Out of work high-level executives and those who want to make a solid change in their career need to read this book in order to sound smart and learn what to expect from good and bad headhunters.
__label__2 " You can't simply read the book, you have to use this workbook.: I read the book and loved it. When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms. Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store. But I was wrong. This book is really two books. The work book is designed to be cut into two different books. One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign. The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook. And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort. The rewards are great. This is a dynimite combination. He is really something else. I recommend this book very highly."
__label__2 " When you need orgainzation, this really helps: The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process."
__label__1 " Do NOT buy this burner!: I ended up w/ this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD, which went toes up after about a month. Less than a year later, I have a completely useless burner that stalls at 6% and then freezes my entire system. After NUMEROUS emails and phone calls to TDK, I finally got ""authorization"" to send it in for replacement. I am so fed up, I am going to buy a Lite-On and wash my hands of it.Look elsewhere....this burner is not work the carboard box it is packaged in."
__label__2 " Kyra's Story: This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!"
__label__2 " nakita's review: i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it."
__label__1 " another nickelodeon knock off: this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games; bad graphics, too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first. just as i did with 5 nickelodeon game boy games that were way overpriced. please dont be as stupid as i was...i suggest you DO NOT buy it."
__label__2 " Great First Game!!!: I bought this game at Best Buy and am glad I did! This game has good levels which are FUN games! I do think they need to add a couple more! Although it may look as though there is only multiplayer, there is a single game. One game which you squirt other players is REALLY hard to control! I don't think you are supposed to control the people! The level is really fun though. When you choose a player(s) the game chooses the other people you are playing against. The sound is really hard to hear but not bad if you turn up the volume. The graphics are okay. All and all I think this is a pretty good game!"
__label__1 " Save your money: If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good, doesn't mean the game is.My 6 year-old doesn't like it."
__label__1 " How to raise the stress level in your house?-Buy Party Blast: This game is a piece of .... The system requirements on the box are misleading. It is tough to explain to a six year old that his brand new game can't be played until you upgrade your video card, even though no reference was made to it on the box.And when the game finally works it looks like a hybrid of 2000 technology meets 1977 graphics."
__label__1 " Not worth your money: This game is ridiculously hard for a game with ""Nickelodeon"" on it. I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play. Spongebob and Tommy let us down. Hard. Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money. I won't be taken in by the ""Nickelodeon"" name again."
__label__1 " Pretty bad: This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak."
__label__1 " TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT: I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!"
__label__1 Not what I expected: I was excited when I first saw this game. We are always looking for a game for our young children to play. There it just not enough games for young children on x-box. This game was a big disappointment! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing. There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player. It just was NOT FUN!
__label__1 Not good: This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. It has horrible graphics and I don't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all.
__label__1 " Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics: We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it."
__label__1 Not what I expected.: Not what I expected. Too much acting. Disappointing to say the least. I will not buy the like again. Oh well.
__label__1 Please don't buy this globe.: E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
__label__2 " Woo-Hoo!!!: The Christmas episodes are always the best. . .I have the other DVD of Christmas episodes of The Simpsons, and I love it! The Christmas episodes are the only ones I want to own on DVD, but it is nice having the other winter-themed episodes on the DVD along with the holiday episodes. I'm glad I don't have to spend $40 on a whole season of The Simpsons just for the one Christmas episode I want. I wish more tv shows had Christmas-only DVDs available."
__label__1 " Love the Simpsons, but this ain't Christmas.: Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here."
__label__1 " Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included."
__label__2 " the simpsons christmas 2: I love this dvd. The reason why I gave it a 4 is because in tis the 15th season, right at the end of act 2 my dvd skips to the end credits. Has any one else seen this problem?"
__label__2 " Kinder But Less Impressive than Joshua: I read the first Joshua book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools. Overall this was a good book."
__label__2 Joshua is a truely the most movig and inspiring I ever read: I'm not very old ut I think that this is by fare the best book I ever read.
__label__2 joshua and the children: This was a wonderful and inspiring story. Words truly can strengthen our spirit. This book was filled with many heart warming words and important messages that can help in our daily living.
__label__2 The story was very interesting and the book worth reading.: I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest. The one thing I did not like about the book was the counties that were mentioned are not counties of West Virginia. I am from WV. Charleston and Huntington were mentioned though which is accurage.
__label__2 " Chunky gamelan: Brassy, spectral percussion.Stark, intimate and boldly intense. Blooms of bicycle bell, musical box and every manner of metal chime, grungily recorded in an up close and personal fashion. Strange and indulgent, reveling in the sensuality of its own clank, scrack and visceral punch.For all it's minimalism this heady music is perfumed and exotic, richly harmonious and rippling with pulsating rhythm. Almost ecstatic, like medieval religious music."
__label__1 " A disappointment: Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
__label__2 " Lots of up-to-date knots: It includes lots of up-to-date knots. You can find the knots you want in a easy way. Also, the knots are categorized by the uses of them by which you can find the common usage of those knots. Easy to use."
__label__1 Its Blaaaaaaa: Its full of pitures and not what I thought it would of been. There are better books then this one I would pass it up if I had known.
__label__2 " Really usable: With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage. It is profusely illustrated with clear, easy-to-read photographs, and has easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. Covering everything from the most basic to the decorative, with suggestions for the use of each, it would be a practical and beautiful assistance for anyone who has always wanted to know how to tie those nifty knots."
__label__2 This is a great book.: I just recently got into tying knots. This is a great book; the pictures are great and it gives good info to boot. I would recommend this book to anyone.
__label__2 " Great book. Informative and well written.: Sometimes you need to ""tie the right knot"" at the right time, and this book helps a lot! Sometimes you need to tie two different size ropes together; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you keen a knot that will slip; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you need a knot that does not slip; this book has a knot for that too! And what if you need to hang up / organize your extension cords...? Use the Fireman's Coil knot! Great book. Lots of color photos taken at each step."
__label__2 " Good Results: I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster"
__label__2 " Wonderful: The story is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Sadly, the author passed away on October 8, 2002, so there won't be any more in the series."
__label__1 " Cups are too thick and molded: The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."
__label__1 Too small: It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered! So they run a lot smaller. It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling.
__label__1 " Cone Boobs: I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
__label__2 " Nice Look, Not A Great Fit!: I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit. Sorry I can't say the same about the Carina bra.I agree with a previous reviewer, the cup size is off, not true to size and that results in ""spillage"". I bought the 40G, the straps are pretty and the lower back fits just perfect. The only con is the cup size, recommend ordering ""up"" one cup size when purchasing this particular bra."
__label__1 " Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support: The elastic used for the band very easily loses it's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). For a molded style, this bra loses it's use after a week. It's pretty but poorly engineered."
__label__2 " Sizing a little off..: I love the shaping this bra gives, but the straps sometimes pop out when I'm putting it on -- so annoying. It's also cut a little smaller than other Le Mystere bras in the band and the cup (think spillage). Otherwise, it's great and much better than any other convertible bra I've EVER tried!"
__label__2 " Perfect Basic Bra: This bra is comfortable and creates a smooth silhouette under all kinds of clothes. It runs slightly small in the band, as usual in this brand, but the cup fits true to size."
__label__1 Awful fit: I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
__label__2 " Nothing compares to Le Mystere bras: During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra."
__label__2 " My son loves this game!: I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
__label__1 " Probably for Little Little Kids Only: Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)"
__label__1 " Doesn't lock well: The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured."
__label__2 " Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
__label__2 " I love this little guy!: I already had a larger combo square which I used like crazy, but for many applications having a smaller square is easier to use. I use it for marking board edges, for making sure my chisels and plane irons are square when sharpening them.... great buy for the price."
__label__2 " Wonderful, inspirational, well done: I first saw this video 15 years ago when I was going through a transition phase of my life which started as a result of an injury. As I was just starting to push through the ""doom and gloom"" and take on new challenges, I found this video by chance. I was powerfully affected by its imagery and message. I watched it over and over, and really clicked with the symbol and image of the magestic bald eagle. To this day, the Eagle evokes in me an image of character, perserverence, courage, fortitude, strength and nobility that I aspire to in my life's roles. This video wonderfully depicts these timeless, universal themes that add purpose and meaning to our lives. I have shared this video with many through the years. I find that most people are ""wowed"" by it, and inspired to different degrees depending upon where they are in their own life journey."
__label__1 " Terrible motivational film: If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down."
__label__1 Choices in Relationships: I requested the book 9th edition and you sent me a student review 4th edition. This is an activity manuel to accompany the book.
__label__1 " Badly Written and Boring: Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. A group of eighth graders could have written something better.The dialog is just plain stupid. I understand that the writer of this movie has gone back to working for a lawn maintenance company, and is given nothing more complicated than trimming shrubs."
__label__2 " Good replacement: Great product is exactly what it says. Good replacement for my mirror which was broken. It is slightly different on the inside but the exterior, after installation, is unnoticeable."
__label__2 " Beautiful, high quality necklace!: This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!"
__label__1 Plagued with problems: I bought a Radeon 8500 to replace my Radeon 7000. When I first installed it the performance and frame rate just blew me away. But then I found out that my card has problems running games and 3d apps. I got a headache from trying to fix it and I'm going to have to send it back to ATI for a replacement.
__label__1 " Causes computer to reboot: This card was big disappointment. I am using it on a dual Athlon MP system with Windows XP Pro. I have had repeated problems with the card causing my system to spontaneouesly reboot. Trying to play live video on a media player such as Windows Media Player or RealPlayer seems to be a particular problem. Applying repeated driver updates from ATI has not helped. The card is very fast, but the system stability issues are driving me crazy and have caused me to remove it from my computer. With a different card my system works great. I have have had good experiences with other ATI cards, but this card (or its drivers) are unstable."
__label__2 " great graphics for the money: great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go."
__label__2 " nice work ATI: ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card)."
__label__2 " Radeon 8500 second chance: Well my previous review for this card was not good. But I just built a new, faster computer and put the Radeon to the test again. My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also. Worth the money-now that is."

Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh!

Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!""

__label__1 " Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between: When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
__label__1 " Cheesy, boring, move on......: I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog."
__label__1 " Very poor story: The only good thing about this movie are the special effects. The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)"
__label__1 " A Lame Ghost Wannabe: Very sad. If you must, rent the ORIGINAL Haunting--a very good flick. This film suffers from the Hollywood mentality: that special effects and big name actors can rescue a weak plot. Was there a single scare in the film? No. Was the ending telegraphed right from the start? Yes. CGI spirits do not make for chills."
__label__1 " possibly the worst haunted house movie made: This movie doesn't scare, it barely entertains and is frustrating to watch capable actors (Zita Jones and Nelson) in limited roles.The script is just plan bad, instead of showing realistic traditional ghost the producer decided to go with high dollar unrealistic special effects that are way overdone.I didn't hate the movie, but I was really disapointed."
__label__1 " About as scary as a "" Facts of Life "" reunion special: The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
__label__1 " One terrible movie!: My girlfriend and I went to see The Haunting and almost walked out. I jumped once in the whole movie. It was slow, the acting was not very good. Do not waste your time with this one! I would have given this 0 stars but they did not have that option. BORED TO DEATH!"
__label__2 " One of the most scariest movies I have ever seen!: This movie has got to been one of the best horror movies I have seen in years. This movie made me so scared, when we saw it in the movie theater, I screamed out ""Oh, my god!"" at one scene of the movie! This movie is a thriller."
__label__1 " Poopy!: Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
__label__2 " i liked Owen Wilsons part. IT was a suprising film that will: This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare."
__label__1 " Things go ""DUD"" in the night: Once again a remake takes a ""Classic"" film ""The Haunting""(the best haunted house movie ever) and retooled it as an effects driven mess. Did they even watch the original or read the wonderful novel? Surely not if this is what they came up with. All the subtler aspects of the first are thrown out in favor of the mind numbing CGI effects. The result is one big dud of a ""thriller"". The cast is good but wasted as the makers seem more intent on showing us what they can do with CGI rather than giving us a true ""chiller"" like the better than ever original was.All in all, not even a nice try!!!"
__label__1 " WHY ?: Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot."
__label__1 " Not scary at all!: The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
__label__2 " The Haunting: I thought this was a great movie. Fine, so the story was average, but the fantastic effects and even better sound more than made up for it. I would recommend this film to anyone with a dolby digital setup, just sit back and feel the room shake!"
__label__2 " A True ""Thriller""!: While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its ""Thriller"" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old ""haunted house"". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park ""fun house"" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind."
__label__1 " the real horror in this horror movie: When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another ""tech show""."
__label__1 " Slept like a baby...: I watched this flick at 1 a.m. Afterwards, I had no trouble falling asleep. When is Hollywood going to realize that showing too much emphasis on visuals makes bad theater? Overdone, bombastic,predictable,CGI effects. The house looked too much like a gaudy museum with ridiculous fixtures. On the positive side,though, the sound effects were great. The bass notes were very well done, subtle shades of ghostly children whispering and eerie creaky sounds throughout the house were the real jewel in this film."
__label__1 " A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative."
__label__1 " I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie: This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic."
__label__1 " Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else: Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled ""The Haunting of Hill House""), Jan De Bont's brainless thriller ""The Haunting"" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the story and logic went. The film's razzle-dazzle visuals make it somewhat fun, but it's unescapably a downer."
__label__1 ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER: THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
__label__2 " Pretty Good Flick: Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less."
__label__1 " Ehhh , nice visuals?: I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
__label__1 " Ultimately, this one's a failure (though not without merit).: Four people are placed in a gigantic mansion as part of a study in fear, but they don't realize the house is actually haunted. Effects-heavy thriller features a decent beginning and a so-so cast (Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fine, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor are spectacularly awful), but eventually falls apart in the last half-hour, with a barrage of cheesy special effects taking over. Add to that the predictability and the sappy conclusion and you have a movie that went from promising to big dud. It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting)."
__label__1 " Numbingly bad.: Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture."
__label__1 " One of the worst of 99...: Question: How do you take an excellent cast, millions of dollars, top of the line FX, base it on a good movie only toturn it into a piece of unwatchable garbage? Answer: Let Jan de Bont direct it."
__label__2 " Awesome Movie!: I went to a sneak preview of this movie when itcame out last July and I loved it! I read the book before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the book and the movie are not really that similiar. I loved this movie because I love haunting movies, scary stuff that makes the audience scream. This one does it, though at the end it is a little far fetched I have to admit, but overall I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting leaves something to be desired on many occasions, however, but a movie like this you don't go to see because of the acting. Four Out Of Five."
__label__1 " Bad horror movie: The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier.Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only acting poorly, she is also a complete misfit in this movie. It's as if she has just been asked to be in The Haunting because the makers want some chick on the screen. But you don't even see any of her sexiness in this movie.Furthermore, there are several ridiculous movie mistakes in The Haunting.There are a few relatively scary scenes and even some good laughs here and there. Apart from that, only Lily Taylor's acting is worth mentioning."
__label__1 Writer and director witoout souls: I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
__label__1 " Wow, What a Disappointment: It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."
__label__2 " Great Movie: I seen this movie too many times to get scared. But I enjoy it each time. I also enjoy watching the special features. The house that they filmed this movie in was really haunted. The movie crew kept seeing, feeling, and hearing things. They also talked about different haunted places in the special features. If you are into haunted movie's you don't want to pass this movie up."
__label__1 " Promises alot. Delivers little.: I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down."
__label__1 " Microwaved horror: Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother."
__label__1 " Unbelievably Putrid: Stay away from this putrid piece of decaying mouse droppings! This is just another fine example of taking a large budget film and creating various computer generated images which look ""COOL"" and write some dialogue and a very weak story line around it. When will people stop being oohed and awed by special effects and appreciate writing content of a movie? The old Julie Harris movie is so superior, see it! You will see what a good movie is! Why remake some a classic with some screenwriter first credit for a movie. I feel the writer rented 20 horror movies, sat and watched them and took notes. ""Hey I like that and that."" If this film comes anywhere near you, use a crucifix or holy water, anything to save 2 hours of your life!"
__label__1 " NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE.: This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
__label__1 " CGI no substitute for story: This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Might have worked as an original idea, but being a re-make of a classic movie, itself based on a classic novel, necessitates living up to the original, which this movie did not."
__label__1 " Just skip it.: 1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time."
__label__2 " Entertaining and Effective: I understand that this was based on the classic book by Shirley Jackson's "" The Haunting of Hill House"" which is an excellent book. May I suggest that those who love ghost stories read Shirley's Book. The original Movie titled ""The Haunting"" that was released in the early '60's, stared Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It was done in black and white and was very effective for it's time in moving it's audience. I highly recommend seeing this version also. Now, this new updated version has hit the screen with great effects, great scenery and vivid color for the modern era. Yes, it to stands alone and is very effective for it's time. I don't feel any of the three medias should be compared. They all stand alone on their own and all should be enjoyed. So I highly recommend that if one enjoys chills up one's spine, they should go out and rent or buy all three versions and enjoy one wonderful experience after another."
__label__2 Two Thumbs Up: I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.
__label__1 " Not Oscar Material: Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those."
__label__1 " This movie insulted my intelligence...: along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
__label__2 " GREAT MOVIE: THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME ALOT OF THE ACTORS ARE YOUNG, I LOVED THE EFFECTS, FOR A OLDER MOVIE IT HAD SOME AWESOME UPGRADES. I AM SO GLAD I OWN IT."
__label__1 " Truly disappointing: This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful."
__label__1 " Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive ""b"" movie??: OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT remake great movies if you cannot do any even better job of telling the story! Its a waste and an annoyance!"
__label__1 " Watch the original instead: Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier."
__label__1 " Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost movies about them): Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here. This movie was the pits."
__label__1 " Must I even give it one star?: Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
__label__1 THE HAUNTING: ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW. THE NEW DEPENDS ON COMPUTER EFFECTS. WHICH WERE PRETTY COOL. BUT DID NOT SAVE THE MOVIE FROM ITS DOWNFALL. ITS LACK OF STORY WAS LAME.NOT SCARY WHAT SO EVER. SEE THE ORIGINAL. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
__label__1 " The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones: I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."
__label__1 " The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through...: It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie."
__label__1 " This is not a horror movie.: This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense."
__label__1 " Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch: I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald's for the rest of their lives. This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video. If you want to see a classic haunted house story and be scared, then get the original movie with Claire Bloom."
__label__2 " A funhouse of special effects.: This DVD has superior picture than the video version. Its a good film of effects and the audio is far superior on DVD. I thought it sounded smooth and clear and dialog is easily heard. Hugh Crane haunted the house with spookier sounds that were unnoticed on video or in most theaters. I love films, but I am not that picky on the tech spects, but if you want to own this film, get DVD. It rules, and its easy to use for anyone who likes movies."
__label__2 " A Children Horror Movie: It's a pretty good movie ! It's more a kids movie, a kids horror movie, those children who Eleanor must save. My 9 year old sister watched it either and she likes the movie either. The ending whas a little weak but overall it's great. Rating: 8,5 of 10"
__label__2 " Welcome Home Eleanor: Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)went to the haunted ""Hill House"" together with three other People, included Eleanor (Lilly Taylor), a bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). Everything seemes harmless... at the beginning of course. But it isn't! Strange things happening to the Guests of the ""Hill House""! Children are talking to them, Statues are moving and bloody footprint are leading them to mysterious places! All this is happening most of all to Eleanor. She is seeing things. Things that nobody else cans see...This is a hillerious Ghost-Story with breathtaking Special Effects and a just perfect ""Hill House""!!!Buy this DVD but beware: ""Everyone lives in Town three Miles away from here. Everyone leaves before Dark. Nobody will come any nearer than that, in the night, in the dark..."""
__label__1 " Expected More: I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you."
__label__1 " The Haunting is just... bad.: If you want a good haunted house flick, get something else... anything else. This film has a pretty set, but no character development, no suspense, no scares, and no point."
__label__1 " Two hours I'll never get back!: When I heard they were remaking ""The Haunting,"" I was excited. I love the original movie. I thought that with the modern techniques we have, we could make a good movie better.I was wrong. Sitting through this stinker was torture. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that's similar to Shirley Jackson's novel and the original movie is the name. Want to do something fun? Go get a root canal. It would be a lot more fun than this movie."
__label__1 " Worst movie I've ever seen: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the classic 1963 version. Not to mention the worst ending I have ever seen. The only things this movie has going for it are the special effects and the house itself even though the house in the 1963 version looked a lot scarier and more sufficating, like it was truely alive. If you get any movie get the original The Haunting."
__label__1 " Really boring: This is probably the worst ""horror"" movie I have ever seen! Don't see this unless you want to be bored to death!"
__label__1 " Boring, not scary: This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it."
__label__1 " It had a lot of potential: If this movie had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. ""I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine! Go to hell!"""
__label__1 " good special effects, but no plot: To think of the courage it took hollywood to actualy claim that this was taken from Jackson's book ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is amazing. I am a big fan of the book and I'm just writing to tell that there is little simularity's between the movie and the book. Only the names are the same and 1 five minute scene is taken from the book. The rest is from the imagination of the screenwriter. I would think that if you are going to change that much of a plot, then you shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as from the book. However, the special effects are amazing, the acting is well done. They should have put another title to it and changed the names of the charecters. Then it could have been there own work. Very disapointing."
__label__1 " Good special effects, lame otherwise: The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)"
__label__1 " Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."
__label__1 INSOMNIA CURE! WATCH THIS MOVIE!: THE MOVIE TAKES SO LONG TO GET INTERESTING YOUR ASLEEP BEFOREYOU KNOW IT.THANK GOD I RENTED THIS!
__label__1 Too Long To Get To The Point: This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
__label__1 " OH MY GOD: Though I have a suspicion that this movie will soon become a cult favorite, currently, it is simply one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror movies ever made. The elements -- including the cast, from a pouting, bi-sexual Catherine Zeta-Jones to an achingly sincere Lillian Taylor, and the plot, which takes a classic Shirley Jackson story and actually takes away the terror -- are each so bad that the end result is one of those movies you watch and say -- how did this ever get made? Redeeming qualities: the set, which is so massive and full of detail that it is interesting to explore, and a few of the special effects, which unfortunately do not help you to understand the absurdly diluted-and-then-regurgitated plot. There could have been a great horror movie from that story, but this is definitely not it."
__label__1 " Just terrible: No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
__label__1 " Absolutely horrible: Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
__label__2 " This is a must see for anyone who likes haunted houses.: This is one movie I would watch over and over again. The story is great. the suspense is great without alot of blood and guts. As it says in the movie"" makes a great bedtime story""."
__label__1 " Huge talents in a poor poor movie: Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie."
__label__1 " I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back: If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?"
__label__1 " Very sorry indeed.: Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money..."
__label__1 " Typical Hollywood Bull Sh*t: What you would expect from a hollywood production. If you LOVE Hollywood, you'll LOVE this, otherwise go check out something that is actually freaky, I.E. The Changling or Suspiria."
__label__1 Please don't even bother with this one: I saw the original movie made in 1963 and it was wonderful. I was very anxious for this remake to come out and man was I disappointed!! It was horrible!
__label__1 " Dismal: I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
__label__1 " About as scary as The Simpsons!: I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!"
__label__1 " what a joke: this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
__label__1 " TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING: It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!"
__label__1 " Don't waste your time, money, energy on this stinker!: I didn't realize this movie was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!"
__label__1 " Try something else.: I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
__label__1 " Not for Shirley Jackson fans: This remake supposedly is based on ""The Haunting of Hill House"" by Shirley Jackson, but there is actually very little of her original novel in this version. In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it's an insult to say it's based on her work.The first film from the 1960's is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it's so scary.In this new ""version,"" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh! And the way it ends is just totally not right! Read the book! See the first version on film! Avoid this new one like the plague.(It's telling -- as of the today, the DVD of the remake is selling for less than the DVD of the first film!)"
__label__1 " This movie stinks!: This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!"
__label__1 " Disgrace: Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see."
__label__1 " this movie sucks!: This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame."
__label__2 " Creepy: Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film.....however I must admit that the atmosphere of the orginal has been reproduced by some great effect and some superb camera work. The actors perform quite well, however they do tend to play second fiddle to the effects - and more importantly the house itself (which is breath-taking). As the film progresses the feeling of dread builds to a good climax, which is slighly more upbeat than that of the original! Nevertheless this film does not deserve the slagging it got in the press and does well to keep up with the black & white version."
__label__2 " Not that bad after all: Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
__label__1 " ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE: How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made. Get the original 1963 version or read the classic novel--BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE!"
__label__1 " Hollywood has run out of ideas......: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
__label__1 " The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted: a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
__label__1 " A waste of time and money: Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
__label__1 " Worst Movie Ever Made: If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along. Very little care was paid to the story when bringing this film to the screen. The only care seems to have been for the special effects. I want my two hours back."
__label__1 " TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR: ""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
__label__1 " Got Carried Away with Special Effects: I thought this movie was really cheesy. It got so carried away with the special effects, that there wasn't enough room for a real story. This new version of ""The Haunting"" was terrible, and it could have been a whole lot better. I don't reccomend this film to anyone who has seen the original, they would be very dissapointed and frustrated."
__label__1 " Go Haunt Yourself!: This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10."
__label__1 " 99.9 FAILURE!: The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
__label__1 " Some movies are just born bad...: To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."
__label__1 " Terrible...!: Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch ""The House On Haunted Hill"" (1999) or ""Thir13een Ghosts"" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"
__label__1 " Worst Film Ever Made, ever!: It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!"
__label__1 Read the Book: What made the book horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters.The ending was completely destroyed. The writers/director/producer should have stuck closer to the original story and this would have been a much better movie: a classic.C'est la vie.
__label__1 " A very poorly done horror movie.: A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
__label__1 " Big Thumb's Down!: Lousy, poorly adapted film that takes an excellent book and tacks on the lamest, un-scariest, unneeded Hollywood ending. Why? Just so it could have a happy ending. Terrible! Terible!"
__label__1 " Come on!: This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."
__label__1 " Boredom personified!: This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
__label__2 " Terrific!: This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. This flick was truly watchable and enjoyable. It will have you glued to your screen! If you love scary movies, don't pass up this one!"
__label__2 " I like it.: I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie."
__label__1 Terrible: To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
__label__1 " Wish I could give it 0 stars: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."
__label__1 " Worst possible remake: I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house."
__label__1 " A waste of valuable money!: I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."
__label__1 " Tell me a story: This film suffers greatly from having nothing at all to say. The set was grand, but the script was lacking and the actors had nothing to do but make it through to their paychecks. Don't waste your time."
__label__1 " Mediocre horror movie: I guess the special effects were OK.... Frankly, however, this was kinda a big disappointment - with fine actors like Neeson and Zeta-Jones you'd expect more. Rather give this one a skip and go watch the 'Scream' movies all over again....."
__label__1 " not bad!: My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this movie but you might find it boring a bit.I dont recommend this to people who enjoy movies that have a good story and directing."
__label__1 " okay movie with a couple scary parts: You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this."
__label__1 " Please!: This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
__label__1 " poor remake: Whoever made this misunderstood the word `scary', special effects make you go ""wow"" not ""aarrgghh! ""Look to the original version."
__label__1 A BAD VERSION OF THE HAUNTING!!!: This was a bad remake of a really original SCARY movie. This remake focuses on the children trapped in the house. The original movie focused on the house and how scary and evil it was. That was what made it scary. The Haunting remake has ok special effects but some were not needed. Whoever reads this review I don't really recommend this movie but if you want to waste a couple of bucks go ahead.
__label__1 " there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty."
__label__1 " skip the movie: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello."
__label__1 " AWFUL!: I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
__label__1 " Sue me: I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?"
__label__2 " Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!: The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
__label__1 What unmitigated....: CRAP!The original Haunting from 1963 has long long been my favourite ghost story....So I was excited tho needless very apprehensive about this remake. Somehow I knew modern Hollywood would mess it completely up. And they did not disappoint me.Completely changed the whole background and story line. Instead of the subtle and eerie horror...you get the gore and obvious.Don't waste any time on this junk. Of course if you are like the majority of clueless americans...this might be right up your alley.
__label__1 " Not frightening, not anything: There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student."
__label__2 " The Haunting: Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film."

__label__1 " Oh no,: It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either."
__label__1 " horribly......stupid: Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing."
__label__2 " Extremely interesting and exciting! A real QUEST!: Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action. It is not an ordinary scary movie or thriller - definitely, it is more... Try it and I think you won't be disappointed at all."
__label__2 " One of the best ""Haunted House"" movies I've ever seen!!: I bought this movie after hearing how creepy it was. I was very surprised how good this movie really was. I really liked the parts with the children calling Elanore to help save them. I am very happy with this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the hottest actor I've ever seen star in a horror movie! This DVD is well worth your movie!:)"
__label__2 " WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe."
__label__2 " Best Haunted House CGI I've Seen So Far: I like haunted house movies and this film is no exception. Yes, it is a ""reimaging"" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I'm also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort."
__label__1 " in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts: there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original"
__label__1 " Horrible: And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost story and tried to do something with it.The problem is that they relied way way way too heavily on special effects. Don't believe me? Watch the original. It will have your skin crawling and had very little special effects.Why do they have to try to rework something that is perfect? I don't get it.If Hollywood is going to rework a masterpiece, then play it straight. Just because you can do all sorts of things with special effects doesn't mean you have to try to put them in remakes, especially if the original is perfect!"
__label__2 " Pretty scary-not so swift ending: I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
__label__1 " AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL: To say that this version of ""The Haunting"" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."
__label__1 " ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM: Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"
__label__2 " Terrific apologetics novel explains Catholicism from Bible: I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the ""Roman"" church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"
__label__2 " A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith: The book ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. And oh, how this is needed in these times of crisis and confusion in church catechesis. A must read for every Catholic of all ages, religious and clergy included, and a great book to share."
__label__2 " Dan's Review: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars."
__label__2 " Lasalle student's book review: I enjoyed this book very much, to my suprise. When my teacher assigned this book, I thought that I would be bored throughout of the whole book. I did not think that i would be to interested in a book about church and Fundamentalism, but as I got into the book I really started to enjoy it. I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better. All of the information about Catholic religion and why mary and peter are respected in the church. This book gave me a great experience in learning things about my Catholic faith that i never thought i would learn. I am glad my teacher gave me this assignment."
__label__2 Stephen Dwyer: A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.
__label__2 " Review For Mr. Puntel: Having read ""A Philadelphia Catholic In King James' Court"" I received a better picture of the Catholic Church. I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."
__label__2 " An online review!: This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the ""conflict"" that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the ""questioning"" and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."
__label__1 " APCIKJC by White: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected."
__label__1 Untitled: This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written.
__label__1 " PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam: This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."
__label__2 " Religion Review - LSCHS Student: After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."
__label__2 " Mr. Puntels Class: The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it."
__label__2 " The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views: Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."
__label__2 " Erik Haney Book Reveiw: I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a very good book. It was very well written and had a good plot. It is the first ever apologetic novel, and it has done a good job in clearing the way for others. In this book, there were many good discussions on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. My favorite parts in the book were whenever, Michael was in the Bible study sessions, and these chapters were very exciting. In the book, there were many good characters that really helped to make this book a lot more interesting for the reader. I especially liked that Michael succeeded in bible study and convinced hid cousin Eli, through his teachings and discussions of the Catholic Church. I thought that the story was well written, and I would love to read a sequel."
__label__2 " Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars."
__label__1 " Misleading entities...: While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."
__label__2 " A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish: Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
__label__2 " Urban Bushmen: The Art Ensemble in top form: Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. The AEC's trademark percussion ensembles, jocular takes on marching music, etc., are surrounded by inspired playing. ""New York is full of lonely people"" is one of Lester Bowie's most enduring and beautiful melodies. Long enough to allow the group to do its characteristic stretching of time on long improvs, this is still, in my view, an accessible record. A great place to start exploring the music of the full quintet version of the band, along with their other ECM albums, and a pair of their live sets from early 70's."
__label__1 " Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0: This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information."
__label__1 " Not very useful: As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book)."
__label__1 sound quality ??????: the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
__label__2 " Looks good, but not for mobile applications.: I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car. It is small, rugged, and runs on 12 volts. I contacted RF Link and they even sent me a unit to try out, along with their amplifier, so that definitely says good things about them. Unfortunately, it did not work at all for me. As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around."
__label__1 Not as advertised: The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
__label__1 " zero customer service: I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase."
__label__1 " Unfortunate Waste of Money: It's a great concept.... connecting A/V devices over a short distance without wires. However, the Rf Link system doesn't quite make it a reality. I tried very hard to use the system to connect a camcorder to a TV/monitor. Even at a very short distance of 10 feet, the signal continously drops. I even tried adding the ""optional"" Rf Link output booster. However, any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver (still at 10 feet) causes the signal to drop out.... totally unacceptable and unusable. The only happy note was Amazon's great customer service and return policy."
__label__2 " Ralph does it again!!: My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!"
__label__2 " Soon to be your kid's favorite: As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
__label__1 " I'd like to see Ralph at the bottom of the sea: Covert writes a bunch of non-sensical, sophomoric songs that my kids simply hate. This guy is a Barney-wannabe and this album does nothing to save his dignity."
__label__2 " ten stars wouldn't be enough!: What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Well-crafted songs with clever lyrics and talented musicianship make for a 50-minute delight. ""At the Bottom of the Sea"" has clever word-play, ""Surfin' in My Imagination"" has some fine surf guitar and inspires some uninhibited dancing, and a great rendition of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" should have you singing in no time with your child. Each song is worth hearing over and over (and over), and this CD is money well spent. My son laughs and laughs at Eighteen Wheels on a Big Rig,"" and I am partial to and extremely appreciative of ""The Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song)."" After all, four bananas make a bunch and so do many more!I am incredibly impressed with Ralph Covert's abilities to reach a child's imagination without shutting out the adults. I am going to buy this as a gift to all parents I know, and I also plan to purchase Ralph's World's first CD. This CD should be at the top of anyone's Wish List."
__label__2 Kelly Jumped Into Our Family!: My daughter is 3 and she loves all of the Barbie items but they are still sometimes too big and hard for her to play with. I finally convinced her to try out Barbie's sister Kelly with this Jumpin Castle playset and she loves it. The playset was not hard to put together - it only took me about 5 minutes. The only thing that did not impress me with the toy is the cardboard cutouts in the box that you fold up to be presents for Kelly. We just tossed those but the toy itself is great and is teaching my daughter how to pretend play.
__label__2 " Fun for a while...: We bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday & she really loved it at first. She especially liked it when her older cousin showed her that she could put other small toys in the castle & pop them out and across the room. However, she lost interest soon after & I haven't seen her play with it in the 3 months since her birthday."
__label__1 " like the doll, but that's it: Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and, in the long run, my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll, I wouldn't recommend this one, just a waste of plastic here."
__label__2 " cabin-worthy: Live in New Mexico and have a summer mountain cabin at 8500 ft in Cloudcroft--brrr. Usually 15-20 at night in January. No other heat source. Got the new Dyna-Glo 23,000 BTU Portable Kerosene Convection Heater up there yesterday at 130 PM and it was 30F in the cabin. it has a 400 sq ft main room and a 280 sq ft upper sleeping quarters. Temp went up to 40 in 1 hr; 50 in 2hrs; and it was 65 in 4 hrs. It was 72 degrees at bedtime, 1030PM, and I filled the tank and went upstairs where it was 58 degrees. Put a CO monitor at the stairwell to go off so I wouldnt die of CO poisoning in my sleep. It never went off. By morning, it was 61 upstairs, and 80 in the main room. The full tank had gone down by just over 1/2 by 7AM. No stink at all and I am sensitive to that. Had to shut it off to cool it down in there for morning coffee! The low outdoor temp only got to 28F, so not sure how it would do in lower temps....will update if/when we try it. GOOD heater, albeit a little slow to get there."
__label__2 " Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain."
__label__2 " Doolittle is Doing a LOT!: First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother? Because Jerome Doolittle's Body Scissor's is worth the read and the write. If you enjoy Crais, Parker et al, you will enjoy Jerome's style as well. Tom Bethany is just the guy I'd like to be--if I were a guy. :-) Read his earlier works- grow with his characters."
__label__1 " First Part: I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update."
__label__1 " This book make my feel bad for a moment and some tests in end have suggestions for buy more book from same publisher: As I see that, book have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of book, only comments like something as ""If you not understand it now, after all what you read, you need buy ""Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies... etc""- what really agressive advertising, make peoples feel scared, stupid and affraid and make them need buy more books from this publisher...Its scare my for a moment!Most helpful for my Peterson ASVAB, what have good explanation for ALL tests. I never not bui something ""for dummies"" again."
__label__1 " not what people think: this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned. Im sure there are better ways to improve your math skills. don't waste your money."
__label__2 asvab for dummies: great book..i have learned a lot!! i recommend this book for anyone who wants to join the military and will soon be faced with taking the ASVAB test.i studied for the math section of the ASVAB and i passed with flying colors
__label__2 " Good item, but could it be better: The book is very easy to read and understand, gives very clear explanations, but it could it be great if it included a practice CD like most ASVAB books now come with..."
__label__2 " Excellent resource: I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information."
__label__2 Very Helpful: This book was very helpful in letting us know about the ASVAB. It showed us how to get a better AFQT score as well as what areas we needed to score higher in to get the job we wanted. It was very easy to use and the practice tests were so helpful. My husband past the test and got the job area he wanted. It also prepared him for what the test day was like and gave him clues on how to stay at ease and help his knowledge be better used. We were in a hurry to study up and it was quick and to the point. I will probably look at other dummies books for other helps.
__label__2 " If you want a higher ASVAB score get this book!: I am currently DEPed into the US Navy.Before taking the ASVAB, I took several online practice exams, as well as the first practice exam inside this book. I didn't do too well on certain portions of the exam.Focusing on the things I had trouble on, and brushing up on the rest of the stuff, I studied for about a month.When I went to take my ASVAB for the first time, I did well on every exam, making a 94 AFQT (scored higher than 94% of applicants).I absolutely recommend this book. It provides more knowledge than is needed to pass the test, and keeps things interesting with side-notes, trivia, and funny comments."
__label__2 " Good book lots of info: It really is a great book it is full of facts. It helps you solve problems and gives you hints for taking the test, most recruiters recommend this, it is also cheaper on here then that garbage store Barns and Noble."
__label__1 Missing pages.: Contents references pages up to 375. Book stop at page 342. Three chapters are missing. Good book up until the missing chapters.
__label__1 Asvab for Dummies: It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
__label__1 " yes and no: I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying."
__label__2 " Getting Ready: It arrived in perfect condition and when they said so. Got this for my son, who wants to go into the Marines. He said, it has helped him with the Math since it breaks it down into layman terms and helped him understand the algebra section which he struggles with. So happy they have a book that focused on the test for military. This should give him a leg up on a good score on the test. God bless all our young men and women who give their all for our freedom."
__label__2 great book: i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best
__label__2 " Was a gift: The book arrived in great shape and on time. It was a gift, so I'm not sure of anything else related to the contents of the book, or if it was helpful to the person who received it as a gift."
__label__2 easy transaction!: great transaction.. book is as described and was received on time.. at the given price this was a good value!
__label__2 " easy to get through!!!: I'm almost looking forward to actually taking the ASVAB after reading through this book- it made everything so easy, even the sections I don't need to excel in! Very clear, and the author is personable enough to make you feel comfortable while learning..."
__label__2 " Great book, very complete!: My husband said this book was excellent, its really helping him study for the ASVAB, he hasnt taken it yet so we dont know what his score will be but he studies everyday using this book."
__label__1 " Few Errors: If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
__label__2 " Great book: This book was wonderful. My son needed it to improve his ASVAB score and it worked really well for us. He did score higher, a lot higher than his orginal score and we were both please with the results. I would recommend this to anyone attempting to take the ASVAB. You will reap the benefits if you read and study the book."
__label__2 Great study guide!!!: I studied my butt off with the help of this book. The practice tests in this book were actually harder than the real ASVAB! That helped me be even more prepared. I only missed 5 questions on the ASVAB! NO LIE! Study this book for about 3 weeks and take it seriously. You will see your scores improve!!!
__label__1 " incorrect practice test answers: I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back."
__label__2 A wonderful help for those interested in the military: This is one of the easiest to follow books on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.
__label__2 Good: Teaches you really good and easy to understand and allows you to learn the asvab with no problem in order to pass with flying colors
__label__2 Amazing book.: This book will help my granddaughter pass the exam for entering the navy. Anyone who wants to enter any branch of the service needs this book to study.
__label__2 LOVE IT!: I Love this book it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . It's not boring either . I love how it describes everything! Definitely a book to get to study for your ASVAB!
__label__2 " already useful: my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this book really helpful on what to study. the preview tests are great mind joggers."
__label__1 " FULL OF MISTAKES!!!!: This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."
__label__1 " Inadequate: The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can't hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections. It's obvious on many test sections that the answer is for a different question. Plus, the questions are way too easy--like training with matchsticks when you're going to have to move tree trunks."
__label__1 LOTS OF ERRORS!!!: This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
__label__2 " Almost perfect: I needed vents for my observation hive. I would have preferred something a bit smaller made of brass, but this is the best I could find. Keeping my fingers crossed, I ordered these up. After assembly of the hive, I found that they actually look pretty good and they do provide the ventilation required for the hive. The louver spacing is also small enough to prevent unintended escapes. A 1"" wood auger makes a hole perfect for proper fit. They are well made and the price is right."
__label__2 great early nick cave: boys next door is a very early incantation of nick cave.pulsating group of song from a master and Shivers is one of the finest songs cave has ever written
__label__2 " Interesting, fun and enjoyable.: I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
__label__1 " aim low: Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests."
__label__1 " DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM or FROM ADAM HERSH: They never sent me one of the items I purchased. I am still waiting for it. Now I just noticed that one of the items I bought from them that was supposed to be 16 x 20"" is much smaller.It has been more than a month after purchasing from them already.BEWARE ADAM HERSH"
__label__2 Very helpful: This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.
__label__2 You're Late Again Lord...: I really enjoyed this book. The author was refreshingly frank and backed up her points with scripture. I would highly recommend this book.
__label__2 " Right On !: This book is a terrific read! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. Karon Goodman is right on with her sense of humor and advice on how to spend your time while in God's ""waiting room"". Patience is not a strong point for me and I'll be darned if Goodman didn't describe me to a ""T"" while speaking of herself! Definitely a must read for those Thomas' out there!!"
__label__2 " This book was me to the core!: I can't express the gratitude I feel toward Karon, for expressing exactly how I've felt about going through ""the wait"" for so long. She hits the nail on the head with every single paragraph of this book. How does she do that? I found myself wanting to read it over and over, and truly contemplating the questions at the end of each chapter. Amazingly, the same answers kept coming up for me, so I truly got clear on what I had to do. Thank you, Karon, and thank you Lord for using her to help me! A MUST HAVE!!!"
__label__2 " Does the job well! Just needs 1 tweak.: I'm not sure how much I can say about a meat tenderizer... it either does the job or it doesn't, and this one does, regardless of the meat. We've tried it on chicken and ribeyes thus far - it allowed the marinade that we use on ribeyes to permeate much better than before, which cuts down on time and makes a better steak! On the chicken, it easily turned standard grocery store chicken breast into restaurant quality tenderness.The handle is great, it's nice & comfy. The shape of the handle overall is ergonomically friendly.The tweak it needs: there are 4 disks in all, and all are stored in the head. The problem is that you MUST store the 3 that aren't in use in the head in order to hold the one disk you're using in place, effectively meaning that all must be washed, even though you're only using one. The benefit to this approach, on the flip side, is that you're less likely to lose a disk."
__label__2 " Excellent tempo: I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. I would rate if 5 stars if it had any headstand prep work."
__label__2 " love it: I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)"
__label__1 " Say what??!!: Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
__label__1 " not very exciting: I bought this video based on the other reviews on this websiteand I do not agree with the others. This video is boring, dull,repetitive, monotonous and unimaginative. Between each sunsalute there are stretches. These stretches repeat cumulatively! This combined with the repetitions of thesun salutes make for too much repetition."
__label__1 Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser: I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace
__label__2 " Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.: As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."
__label__2 " Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (""A Year in Provence,"" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his ""diary"" makes for a good read and a good history lesson."
__label__2 " Eternal City: The word ""journal"" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."
__label__2 " Babies LOVE this book!: We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
__label__2 " This is my baby's favorite book!!: I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day. She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago. She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes. This is her favorite toy."
__label__2 " Can't go wrong w/ an old fashion cross track: We have one of these, and while we're not always able to work it into our layout on the train table, it's definitely been in some of our favorite configurations. Plus, it provides for that all important ""train crash"" action when two engines are trying to cross at the same time!"
__label__1 " ADS Instant Video: You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient."
__label__2 " Not a Hollywood Expose: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."
__label__2 " More Mrs. Heelis than Beatrix Potter: This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint."
__label__2 Good replacement part: This was a good replacement brake pedal pad for my 98' Toyota Tacoma.A little tough to get on but it does need to fit tight and does after you get it on.Thanks AMAZON for having parts like this.
__label__1 Bummed: This pedal was for a standard tranny - much to small for my automatic transmission brake pedal.I must of misread the description or something. Not inclined to go back and reread the description.
__label__2 " Been Reviewed!: In my last review I said this book makes for edgy, fascinating reading! It is hard to put this book down! I also read this book as a senior in high school, between ages 17 and 18 years of age!"
__label__2 " Definately worth knowing: I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read ""Diary of a Madman"", ""The Nose"", and ""The Overcoat"". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."
__label__2 " Oddity of the Crazed: A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over."
__label__2 " Great Story!: If you have ever lived in a small rural town you will certainly be able to relate to and appreciate Jack Polidoro's latest novel, RETURN TO RABY. If you have not had this living experience, Polidoro's novel will enlighten you as to just what you have been missing! Polidoro's novel is based on the reality of a small New Hampshire town that comes alive page after page and truly shows how rural life can be. Having lived in a ""Raby""like town myself, I could relate to the story first hand. I passed the book on to friends who have never been out of the city and the book was equally enjoyable to them! This story will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. You will be left will a warm feeling and a positive outlook on life. This is truly a wonderful story!"
__label__1 " A poster? Really?: This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
__label__1 " a fine freshman composition text that costs too much: It is sad that this book--and the comprable ""Short Prose Reader"" from McGraw-Hill--are seriously compromised by the greed of a publisher that prices a book in its 8th edition that could be marketed profitably for less than ten dollars and prices it out of the range of poor students."
__label__1 " Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour."
__label__1 " hummm: A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!"
__label__1 " Nope, nope: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
__label__1 Only use if original pins are broken.: I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik
__label__2 " Dorman 38437 Door Hinge Repair Kit: This Kit did work , but if I was to do it again i would go for the kit with threaded studs"
__label__2 " Young man crazy about this book: Looking at this collection really shows the diversity in Hokusai's long career. In one of the essays, the writter comments that Hokusai changes his style so much that his work looks like the work of a different artist. The breath of this volume helps the viewer see how creative and inventive this master is. What I like about Hokusai is that his personal life is just as interesting as his work. The essays included do a good job placing the differnent periods in context with the times and Hokusai's own massive body of work."
__label__2 " Lovely: I saw Beth Waters perform at Slims in San Francisco. I was not planning on getting there early enough to see her. I am so glad I did. I bought three copies of her CD, and hope to see and hear LOTS more from her! She opens her mouth, and out comes this beautiful, rich voice. She is young, and I think will grow as a singer and performer, but... trust me, this is a CD worth owning."
__label__1 " Not good quality: This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?"
__label__1 Do Not Buy: I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
__label__2 Gyroscope: The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.
__label__1 " zero durability: the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all."
__label__1 " Rather plain: Disappointed by this item. I bought a couple of ""crystal"" decanters at the same time, which cost only a few dollars more. The difference was striking. This set is very dull, ordinary glass, and the rubber stopper in the decanter looks cheap."
__label__2 " Best Thing Ever Created!: My 3 year old is in LOVE with paint and this makes the whole idea of ""Painting"" more bearable for me. Instead of cleaning up paint messes on the carpet, on her and on the walls - I can sit her down on the sidewalk with this and she can paint away on everything (including the trees) to her heart's content. Wish they offered more colors, but being able to teach her that Blue+Yellow=Green is also a bonus."
__label__1 doesn't wash off that easily: We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.
__label__1 " Not how I thought it would be: The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight."
__label__2 " A very good read: Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed."
__label__2 " Wonderful: We had to watch this in French class and I thought it would be a really boring movie, but it wasn't. This is a wonderful movie for students studying french and anyone who likes the language. Jean de Florette is the movie before this one and it is also awesome."
__label__2 " an absolutely breathtaking score - captured my imagination!: just.....mmmmm....stunning....i listen to it when i want to BE french, to be in love and feel my heart break, to transport myself somewhere else in time. gorgoise!!!!"
__label__2 Jean de Florette et Manon des sources: bien aim� ses deux films et aimerais les achet� si vous pouvi� me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une r�ponse de vous.
__label__2 " The final chapter of Jean de Florette: Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
__label__2 " a fabulous sequel: As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed."
__label__2 " great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, ""Jean de Florette"", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!"
__label__1 " Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: A note of caution regarding this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import dvd under any circumstances. In an act of artistic mutilation, the pivotal and brief, chaste yet joyful nude dance scene featuring Manon is prudishly obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (though we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it. BTW, my rating applies only to the Korean import, other versions (dvd or vhs) get five stars."
__label__1 " Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: I have only one thing to say about this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import version under any circumstances. In this version, the pivotal, brief and completely chaste nude dance scene featuring Manon is obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (but we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it."
__label__2 " Good performances: I bought this CD because it's one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. The sound quality is good, and the guitar tone is good as well. I thought the tempos of the Suite were a little fast, but otherwise, a nice CD reference of Tansman's work."
__label__2 " A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters: I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable."
__label__1 " Won't work in Dimage 7i: Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
__label__1 " Wouldn't recommended: This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). I reformatted the disk few times and I'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera. Since it has a life time warranty on it, I'm RMA it back to SimpleTech."
__label__2 " Great Product, Wonderful Price: I got this at an excellent sale price, and I have never regretted it. I haven't had a single problem with the card, and I didn't have to reformat it for it to work with my Canon A40."
__label__1 " Too much money for a medicore card: The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company."
__label__1 " Speed IS actually an issue!: I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys?! My card didn't lock anything up, but it wasn't as responsive as two other brands that I currently use (I won't name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate). I do believe that I won't try them again until I hit upon their ""good"" cards though."
__label__1 " It's dead on the first day!: I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500. I tried it by taking a couple of pictures. Suddenly, the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error. :( That was only 10 minutes of using it. Then I tried it with a Canon G2...still did not work...had to return it..."
__label__1 " Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!: Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card, started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error, and acted upon the recommendation to format the card. After reformatting the SimpleTech card, still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos. I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon's wonderful return policy. I really do love this e-tailer!My ""meager"" Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine...."
__label__1 " Compatibility issues - Be careful!: ...I bought this card thinking I could install it in my FujiFilm FinePix S2Pro and have no problems, but I got errors that could not be cleared by in-camera or Windows formatting of the media.I have never had a problem with CompactFlash before, and of the half dozen manufacturers I have, including Lexar, Sandisk, Nikon-branded, Fuji-branded and some Brand-x I picked up at Frys, all of them work in my S2Pro, whereas only one of the SimpleTech cards will.Better safe than sorry!"
__label__1 " Is NOT compatible with Minolta DiMage 7i: I purchased the 256 mb compactflash card to increase the number of photos I could take, however after inserting it into my Minolta Dimage 7i, it gives a message of ""Unable to use card"". I emailed Amazon with the results of my problem, and also asked if others had the same problem (they did not state there was any problem)and they promptly sent me another thinking I only had a bad compactflash. The SECOND one also gives the same message. I will be returning both. I have purchased another brand somewhere else and it works fine. So,If you own the Minolta Dimage 7i - save yourself some time and headaches in returning it - THIS WILL NOT WORK!"
__label__1 " It does not work with Minolta 7i: It works with SimpleTech STI-UCF100 Reader,but not with Minolta 7i. It says ""Unable to use card"".Formating does not help."
__label__1 " I'm afraid it sucks.: I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky."
__label__2 a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.
__label__2 " It keeps working!: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received."
__label__2 Very fast!!: Simpletech's 256MB CF is very fast. I use it with my Canon camera and love it. It gives me quick transfer rates with high resolution. Same time and money and any headaches.
__label__1 " defective: After 6 months of very light use, this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip, taking 100 or so important shots with it. Cannot afford to use this kind of quality again."
__label__1 " Crapped out on me.: Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for."
__label__1 " Not for use with Canon Powershot: It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously."
__label__2 " Check out the SPEED! From a Digital Guru.: I've read many reviews about Compact Flash card speed and a couple of them here on Amazon. I read one review that listed some very high speeds for other brands, above 8000 kb/s. I don't know where that data came from, but in independant photo review sites, this SimpleTech card screams. No other brand was faster. By the way, no brand has ever tested in Camera's that even came close to 8000 kb/s or above.Most CF cards test in at around 2000 Kb/s, some well known brands(SanDisk and Lexar) are at 800kb/s not 8000!!!! If you really want the truth, no card does well in Nikon's. They read at one bit, other cameras,Canon, Minolta etc read with 4 bits, are more advanced and produce superior results with both read and write speeds. The more advanced Camera's do make a difference. Check out independant reviews first, before you buy a camera or a card for your camera."
__label__1 " CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews: After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble."
__label__1 " Too slow? Fast enough? Unreliable is more like it!: After reading some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. I purchased two and put them to the test. I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader. For reasons I can't explain, the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up. To double check if it was something else, I reproduced the problem 3 more times. I didn't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar, no prob!! So on to the second card. Guess what, no freezes, but the folks in the ""it's a slow card"" camp are right! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows? I just know I don't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches. Mine were returned. Good luck, though....."
__label__2 " What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor."
__label__2 " A wonderful discovery: Mart�nez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalb� evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure."
__label__1 Dragon Fire: I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
__label__1 " basic grammer: This book contained some useful information on the basic grammer of the english language, but was mediocore (at best) compared to the Yarber's previous book (reviewing basic grammer, also available on amazon.com)"
__label__1 " oh shut up!: I found this book so over the top it was absurd. In one chapter it actually states that most people who try pot don't feel any difference at all and wonder what all the fuss is about. Give me break. I'm not anti marijuana, but I do feel there is a time and place to use it. The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible. Of course the economy as we know it would collapse but we would be too stoned to care. I thought the book would give a more factual account of the pros and cons I was dissappointed that it turned out to be such a fairy tale."
__label__2 " Perfect Fiction: One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Challenging, epic, and stunningly beautiful writing. As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in."
__label__1 " Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit."
__label__1 " I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.: This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype."
__label__1 " What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it: This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly."
__label__1 " What's the fuss all about?: I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
__label__2 " Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude: I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."
__label__2 " For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature."
__label__1 Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time.
__label__1 " Disappointing - this is not the Colombia I have found: This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail."
__label__1 " Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it."
__label__1 " pointless: I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it."
__label__1 " Over rated and too politically correct: I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it."
__label__1 " Confusion. Intrepidation. Asphyxiation.: In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere."
__label__1 " Huh?: What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."
__label__2 " A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."
__label__1 " The worst book ever: When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read."
__label__1 " Maybe I just don't get it: Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his ""favorite book ever"". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."
__label__1 " Started out good..: I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it."
__label__1 Yawn.: Characters aren't interesting. The story is not compelling. The plot is not engaging. No mystery of any kind. Just dull. Much ado ... why?
__label__2 One hundred years of solitude: I received confirmation that the book had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. The book was in great shape and the price was exceptional.
__label__1 " I hated this book: This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end."
__label__1 " Disappointment: I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
__label__1 " Magical, mystical piece of tripe: I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
__label__1 " Not for everyone: I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it ."
__label__1 " Glad to be done with this one: I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
__label__1 " Absolutely Awful: I was very excited to read this book, and plunged right in when it arrived. As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is a complete waste of time-- so don't be fooled by people who claim this book is beautiful, like I did. It's anything but."
__label__1 100 years of tortured reading: I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
__label__1 " The author put one over on us...: 10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!"
__label__1 Most overrated book of the century: So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
__label__2 " A mirage of life: One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
__label__2 " amzing and intellectually enriching: the book talks about passion, war, defeat and glory, family dramas and political upheaval. the book is touching and a good reading for understanding latin america and its people. praise for garcia marquez for such a landmark novel."
__label__2 " I am in love with Gabriel Garcia Marquez...: A truly, life-changing experience. Magic realism, cyclical time, who could ask for anything more? Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for giving me this treasure and creating a cultural mythos for all of us."
__label__2 a major classic: i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.
__label__2 " One of the greatest novels!: Maybe G.G. Marquez's style is a little bit confusing. Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or ""Christ versus Arizona"" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."
__label__2 A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book! Highly recommended!
__label__2 " A Sea of Latino Enchantment: I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds...."
__label__2 Takers and Leavers a Continuum: Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center.
__label__2 " Fantastical history of a common clan: This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention."
__label__1 " Not impressed: I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never ""get"" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me. I regret I could not finish Nobel prize winning author or not- maybe at some future date I will go back and try again. Sorry ----"
__label__2 " Don't give up too soon.: This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens."
__label__2 " In its own class....: I just finished reading ""100 Years of Solitude"". I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out."
__label__2 " Fascinating but confusing: One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the ""first of the family line"" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."
__label__2 " Not for the impatient or inattentive: I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =)."
__label__2 " Perfect: This is the definition of literature. Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition. I dare a serious, mature reader to pick this book up and not at least admire the writing. And the ending is something else altogether. Garcia-Marquez leaves the reader to ponder it. I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life. A MASTERPIECE."
__label__2 " Allegorical Fiction At Its Finest: The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space."
__label__2 " Written with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!: One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of ""whaat!"" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!"
__label__2 " Opens up worlds: Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved. He has expressed a preference for 'The Autumn of the Patriarch'. But for the rest of us '100 Years' opens up worlds, opens up minds and opens up literature. If you haven't read it you are missing a dazzling milestone in 20th Century literature."
__label__2 " The great(est) American novel.: If you consider America the landmass on both sides of the equator betwixt the Atlantic and Pacific -- then American literature is truly enriched by everything that's written between Baffin Island and Cape Horn. As a young student in high school in American lit we read Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Fitzgerald -- great reading to be sure -- but only one slice of the expansive American experience. It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style"
__label__2 " A Fantastic Story: 100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. Throughout the history of this one family, it is hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction. The best comparison would be to ""Big Fish"" in which the stories are tall-tales, but yet not without fact. All in all, I recommend this book to everyone."
__label__2 " One Hundred Years of Solitude: An amazingly beautiful lyrical book which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book. And most delightful of all, the images linger long after the last page has been read."
__label__2 " A masterpiece: My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty."
__label__2 " Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear. This book is hard work, but only hard work yields great rewards.Best book in Latin American history and one of the 5 best books in human history."
__label__2 " One Hundre Years of Solitude: It is a wonderful journey where the author takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere.It may takes you a while to understad I read the book 3 times the first time I had it and so far I read it 8 times in my lifetime and it never stops to excite me.You want to forget your problems, travel to Macondo and learn about making gold and many other things! discover another world."
__label__2 " AMAZING book: There is very little that I can say that hasn't already been said. In short, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. It changed my life. It comes, as you might guess, VERY highly recommended."
__label__1 " lesson in depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
__label__1 " Zzzz ...: One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story."
__label__1 " Very boring and confusing.: I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple."
__label__1 " Classic?: I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."
__label__1 " 100 Years of Absolute Torture!: This book is long, dull, boring and confusing. It lacks the passion that makes Love in The Time of Cholera so beautiful. It make ""Tess of the D'Urburvilles"" look like a fast-paced romp. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"
__label__1 " A skilled rapist: The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."
__label__1 " All tell, no show: I read literary fiction, ""smart"" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."
__label__1 " Not a fun read: I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."
__label__2 " One of my best reads: A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of ""small town Latin America"". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His ""Novel Prize"" in literature was well deserved."
__label__2 " A Very Important Novel: One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
__label__1 " 100 years of slow reading: This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as ""Love in the Time of Cholera"".Give it a miss and try ""Blindness"" instead."
__label__1 " big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
__label__1 " one hundred years of futility: This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic."
__label__1 " At page 250 I'm still struggling and am an avid reader!: I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down."
__label__1 " 100 years of boreitude: I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
__label__1 " Confusing, Long and Boring: Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!"
__label__1 " I wanted to stab my eyes out...: This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a ""preferred book"" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it. I found it BEYOND tedious.What's wrong with me? Why does everyone love this novel and I found it so annoying?Sign me ~BEWILDERED"
__label__1 " Gave Up On It: found this a very weird book,just couldn't get going with it..maybe it was the translation..I might try again soon"
__label__1 " Disappointed: I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."
__label__2 " So many Buendias: This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a ""classic to read over the summer"". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your ""things to read to remain well-rounded"" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"
__label__2 It`s hard to read it but u will be amazed by it: It was the first great book i`ve read and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this book is great.It`s just perfect.i love GGM and his style.He just manges to express feelings so easily and everything in this book seems perfectly beliveable even if some things are magical and don`t get in connection with reality.This book is hard to review.One must read it to understand it.It`s just that one cannot resume this book here.This book must be experienced.
__label__2 " The World Repeating Itself...: The Story of Macondo and the Buendia family. What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us."
__label__1 " GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!: CUZ THIS BOOK IS A ""SNOOZE FEST!""ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
__label__2 " Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
__label__2 " Among My Most Common Recommendations: As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!"
__label__1 " A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
__label__2 " Not for chickens: This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics."
__label__2 " An exceptional book; Beautiful!: There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it."
__label__2 " I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've ""finished"" it. it always pulls me right back into it."
__label__1 " Enough is Enough: Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel."
__label__1 Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
__label__1 " Pretty stupid: Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or ""Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."
__label__1 pointless: This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
__label__2 " Must read for everyone: It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally read this novel. It was well worth it, and I have read it again since then. It is a little hard to read, but it is a classic. I suggest that you use the family tree in the front of the book. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters. It may take you a little while to become completely imersed in the story, it starts out a little slow. But, it will be well worth it to keep going."
__label__2 " Still reading, but definitely a keeper: This is a classic that I've heard so much about. I enjoy a good fiction novel and thus far, am liking this book."
__label__2 " One of my Favorite Books of All Time.: If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
__label__2 " An Absolute Good: I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life."
__label__2 " Magical Blend: Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century."
__label__2 " Oprahs may be the devil...: But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont."
__label__2 " Thank goodness...: ... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, ""rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."
__label__2 " Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try."
__label__2 " One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!"
__label__2 " sensational and invigorating: ""One hundred years of solitude"" is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. The family is being torn by the desire for solitude, as the Colonel becomes very aware of, and the need for love. Many characters repeat history, doing what theyre ancestors have done. This is a splendid book that was and easy read, but had alot of messages underneath the explicit."
__label__2 " Use of language: I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
__label__2 " Best I've ever read.: Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"
__label__1 " Tedious: I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."
__label__1 " One of the few books I have stopped reading: I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"
__label__1 " Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book: I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
__label__1 " One Hundred Years of Solitude: Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it."
__label__2 " This book doesn't need anybody's blessing.: I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature."
__label__1 " 100 years to read, a bramble of impenetrable verbage...: It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one."
__label__1 " Oh, my.: I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."
__label__1 " I just don't get it...: After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
__label__1 " Struggling: I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."
__label__1 " Would've taken me 100 years to read: I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or ""difficult"" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."
__label__1 " The most painful reading and I did finish it.: My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny."
__label__1 " The emperor has no clothes: Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep."
__label__1 " Rambling, boring, and confusing: Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale."
__label__1 " ARRRRRRRGH: I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
__label__1 " Terrible: I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one."
__label__1 " I don't like it: The story is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Most of the characters in the story have the same name , who suddenly die and get replaced with another character with the same name. It becomes confusing after a while to track who is who, who is dead or alive or who is the parent of who. I stopped reading about half way because I was lost and confused. The book is not a light or fun read, it requires great concentration and mental effort."
__label__1 " Appalling. . .: I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."
__label__1 " One Hundred Years of Solitude: This book has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any author on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo.........but really, the nobel prize for literature for 400+ pages of such bore and repetitiveness. I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material. Nobel Prize..huh..make a good soap opera."
__label__1 " Glad I'm not alone in my opinion: I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it."
__label__1 very bad paper quallity: very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase.
__label__1 " Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point: I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a ""modern classic"", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."
__label__1 " I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....: I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me."
__label__1 " Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work: I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was."
__label__2 " Brilliant: I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way."
__label__2 " ******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it."
__label__2 " Rewarding.: This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding."
__label__2 " A Beautiful Translation: This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!"
__label__2 " Amazing!: This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"
__label__2 " The purest novel describing the human condition.: This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition."
__label__2 " 100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)"
__label__1 " What a drag!: I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!"
__label__1 " This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money."
__label__1 " Not the best book ever: My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag."
__label__1 " Bad, bad, bad: What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."
__label__1 " Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?: Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
__label__1 " babbling: Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book. End of story."
__label__1 " I tried really hard....: I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next....."
__label__1 " UGH...one of the most confusing books I've read to date: This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money."
__label__1 " Book: This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
__label__1 " Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."
__label__1 " Disappointing read: I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess."
__label__1 " Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.: I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
__label__2 " Well-written but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel."
__label__1 " Fine, if you're that way inclined: Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle."
__label__1 " Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."
__label__1 " The Emperor's New Clothes: Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here. And to prove it see the review by Ann Pate ""Annie Pate"". Kind of remind me of Yoko Ono selling John Lennon underwear, all you get is the name and dirty laundry. I will bet my bottom dollar that most people only read this because it was on Oprah's reading list."
__label__1 " Creative but boring and aimless: Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype."
__label__1 " I DON'T GET IT: I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
__label__1 " One hundred spastic pages: I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy. I hated it and only got as far as 158 pages before I gave up."
__label__2 " Not for everyone, but if it's for you .... Hold On!!: As many reviewers have noted, it is not an easy ready but well worth the time and certainly the effort.There is love, intrigue, war, life, death, laughter and tears. All told in the classic Latin American Literature style. What more can a reader ask for?Pick it up, read it and dream about the characters for days."
__label__2 " Excellent: A fascinating, difficult read. One Hundred Years of Solitude is a book that shouldn't be rushed through. Take your time and read at your leisure. If you hurry through it you will miss the beauty of this mesmerizing book."
__label__2 Get the tape: I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical.
__label__1 " I was surprised!: I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more ""light"" in both style and heart."
__label__1 " look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?: well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
__label__1 " more stars than the firmament....: I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
__label__1 Super dissappointed: I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
__label__1 A fad which no one will remember in 100 years: so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.
__label__1 " uncannonized: doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"
__label__1 " And the point is?: The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?"
__label__1 " why fill your mind with trash?: this book was trash to my mind, why fill your mind with junk? What good knowledge are you getting from this book, knowledge that is valuable to the mind and soul? NONE! It does not leave you with a good feeling!"
__label__1 " A book that left me indifferent: This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed..."
__label__1 " Extremely overrated: I can't understand the buzz about this book. I've tried to finish it twice and failed each time due to boredom.Perhaps it is better in Spanish. Is that why people love it? Personally, I can't understand why this is considered a classic."
__label__1 " Colombian family values -- part II: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"
__label__2 " Amazing!: Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time. Highly recommended."
__label__2 Great mount for my 40 inch LCD TV: We love this corner mount. It is plenty big enough and stong enough for our 40 inch Sony LCD TV. It's just what we needed!
__label__1 " Sorry but you're out of luck: Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40"" LCD. I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."
__label__1 " Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far: This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle."
__label__2 " A great mount: I purchased this mount to hold my 40"" Samsung LCD. I needed a mount that would attach to the back of the cabinet yet allow the TV to extend out - that's where the 27"" reach of this mount really shines. All the necessary hardware (and then some) were included. Solid yet flexible. I'm very satisfied w/ this mount."
__label__1 " Horrible: I purchased this card with the adapter. The card worked fine in my cell phone, but when I used plugged it into the adapter, my computer wouldn't read it. I know it wasn't my computer because other cards work fine. I contacted the company and one rep gave me the run around (via email). So I called them and the man was kind enough to send me a new adapter free of charge. That one didn't work either!! Waste of money!"

Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs [$$$] a minute! I finally talked to Emachines' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC. I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy. I give this card 1 star because I can't give it any less than that.
__label__1 " Waste of money!: What a waste of money!!!! I was sooo exited about receiving this book, and especially because the reviews were so good. But a complete dissapointment. Hardly any pictures. Each hotel has a page or two briefly describing it, with artsy pictures which i hate, cause you only see a close of a stupid door handle, or a side of a table. IT MAKES ME INSANE WHEN PICTURES ARE LIKE THAT. PUT THE WHOLE PICTURE IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE! So if you think this book will show you complete pictures of hotel rooms, and lobbys your mistaken. Dont bother!"

__label__2 " Good, but not the best.: Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura."
__label__2 A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.
__label__1 " Disappointing: I bought this book as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other ""professionals."""
__label__2 " A book to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book. But this isn't like one of those health books that preaches all kinds of impossible advice. It's filled with really simple recipes. The ones I've tried are easy to make, and taste delicious. It's food for kids as well as adults. At last, we've got a book on the kitchen shelf that we can trust completely."
__label__2 " Easy to understand advice about diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines."
__label__2 " Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar: I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!"
__label__1 " Eat away diabetes ""Yuk"": the book was easy reading with some interesting facts.But...the recipes were not very palatable. I gave the muffins I baked to the birds because they tasted like bird food and the rest of the dishes I tried to feed to the dog.I do not recommend this book.There are more out there with more information about diabetes and better recipes."
__label__2 " The Man! The Myth! The Hair!: This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song ""Rockin' This Joint Tonight"" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me."
__label__2 " Planning for elder care from a family point of view: Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis. Long-term Planning for Your Parents is a easy to read guide for families who are planning ahead or those who need to make informed decisions quickly about long term health care/living arrangements. What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research. I would recommend this booklet for parents and adult children, work/family resource professionals, and companies who provide resources for their employees on balancing work and family."
__label__2 " The Best Of The City Watch Books: In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. It was a great sequel to Guards,Guards and I really looked forward to reading it at the time. I enjoyed the introduction of the new members in the Watch since it gave the book a bit more variety. The plot between Carrot and Angua was also intriguing at the time. Im a big fan of Terry in general but the Watch( Commander Vimes in particular ) hold a special place in my heart. Keep up the good work Terry, your doing a great job."
__label__1 " No Footnotes?!: I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!"
__label__2 " Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful! If you're driving, jogging, or even folding laundry, this audio narration is perfect for those times when you can't pick up the book and read for yourself."
__label__2 Fell of my bed laughing!: This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I read. Now I have 10 others. This book was funny in so many ways. One of my favorite things is Mr. Pratchett's use of footnotes. The one about Bloody Stupid Johnson is the best! I highly recommend the whole Discworld series to every reader.
__label__2 " My first Pratchett book -- I'm hooked!: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."

__label__1 " Kindle Price Too High: Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."
__label__1 " The book itself gets 5 stars: ...but for the money, they need to do a better job with the footnotes in a Terry Pratchett book. At some point there is a bookmark that gets embedded in the text, so all following footnotes are off by one and you have to do prev page to see the right one. Also part of another footnote or 2 get embedded the same way...kind of ruins the effect."
__label__1 " HarperCollins needs to get with the times: Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."
__label__2 " Nice and necessary: Meet Carrot, Angua, Vimes and the other watchmen in their debut performance as they leap into the Discworld. This is the first of the ""Vimes"" stories, so it is important for a basic knowledge of people you`ll be seeing a lot more of(depending on the humour of old man Pratchett). It`s no less funny than the others, while at the same time introducing detective work into the series as Vimes and his crew bumble along on a sinister case. They are, after all, policemen(no offense to policemen in general). Read it and love it. It`s different, but at least as good as the other Rincewind and Death books."
__label__1 " Warning!: This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]"
__label__2 " Pratchett is Magical: Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story."
__label__2 " Terry Pratchett is a great author!: This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read."
__label__1 " I didn't catch the catch: This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."
__label__1 " Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star: There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."
__label__2 " It's Abridged?: Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all. Corporal (now Captain) Carrot is the catalyst of the change in the Watch, hiring 3 new members. Lance-Constables Angua, Cuddy, and Detritus (the former splatter of the Mended Drum). With the ongoing gangfights with the dwarves and trolls, Detritus and Cuddy put aside their differences and, with the help of Carrot, recruit more members to solve the mystery of Discworld's first -and only- ""gonne""."
__label__2 " I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!: This was the second book I read by Terry. Since then, I've loved Discworld books about Ankh-Morpork (and especially the night watch). To get the full effect, read Feet of Clay, then Jingo right after this one."
__label__2 " Why Ankh-Morpork is in trouble: This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion."
__label__1 " high school writing!: this is probably one of the worst books i have ever read. the prose is stilted and trite. i think the only reason it got published was because it is about a lesbian relationship. the characters are flat - no depth is allowed them. there are so many more and better books about lesbian relationships, start with those. if i were to rewrite it, i would yell ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" at the writer in a fit of rage. the sentences are reminiscent of Hemingway, except lack his literary value. everyone is rich and beautiful. it is the 90210 of the lesbian fiction world."
__label__2 " Not Bad: I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
__label__2 " fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging."
__label__1 " Very disappointed: I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality. I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly. I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time. (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)"

However, the way they repersent the fat kid, I believe Robe was thy name, is perposturous and insulting towards my superior intelligence. He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him. I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties. With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk?

__label__2 " Excellent Family and Social Psychology Novel...: This Reader's Digest Reissue of M. Millar's ""Stranger.."" is long overdue. Most interestingly, the author is very similar to her late husband, the better known Ross MacDonald (Ken Millar) in exploring hidden family secrets, without the hard-boiled detective (usually Lew Archer) that made her husband famous. But Mrs. Millar is expert at depicting all social classes, including Mexian immigrants, and their family interests, and has a sly humor that keeps this book amusing thruout. Possibly the book drags a bit, but still a top drawer family history suspense novel!"
__label__2 " Future: Despite being released at the turn of the 90's, 'Accelerator' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either 'FSOL' or 'LifeForms', and if they are remembered for anything it will be 'Papua New Guinea', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic. In 1992, it seemed as if intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate an irreversible shift in musical culture, and although FSOL didn't leave much of a legacy, this makes Basement Jaxx doubly pitiable."
__label__2 " A great cd to listen to while driving cross-country!: This high performance album by FSOL was a ground-breaker when released in the early 90's. Some had heard the phenomenal track, ""Papua New Guinea"" with angelic singing by Riz Mazlin (AKA Neotropic, and Small Fish With Spine) on the ""Cool World"" Movie Soundtrack and wanted more. Well, this album delivers a sonic bouquet for the senses, that is sometimes harsh, dreamy, and does not disappoint. It has not left my CD changer in over 7 years."

It has more the plan one bass beats. But i love some of the songs. I mean i love all the songs but if you like hardcore tchno.... i would'nt suggest the first disk. But buy it anyway becauser the second disk is fabulous!! Its the papa New Gueni (or how ever you spell) remixes. Hibrid,blue states,simone,mellow and more remix papa new gueni. The second cd in my apinion is better but its always different opinions. you should defenetly put some thought in and buy this album. its great!!!!"
__label__1 " Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea: I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about ""Papua New Guinea"". Believe the hype about ""Papua New Guinea!"" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable (""Calcium"" and ""Expander""), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear ""Papua New Guinea"", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price."
__label__1 " Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat: This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down."
__label__2 " Future Sound Of London - 'Accelerator' (Cleopatra): Good electronic/ambient artist's very first CD,originally put out in 1991.Took me awhile to land a copy of this title.FSOL is strictly a duo,members are Garry Cobain and Brian Douglas.Really quite a piece of work here,that is IF you dig this genre.Tracks that I remember to my liking were ""Expander"",their inspiring single ""Papua New Guinea""(have seen this tune mentioned in magazine reviews and articles before),""1 To 8"" and ""Pulse State"".Should appeal to some fans of The Orb,Meat Beat Manifesto,Sky Lab and Chemical Brothers."
__label__1 " Seasoned practitioners--don't bother: This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
__label__1 " Designer Dependent: This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)"
__label__1 " In-line Writing Style: This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake."
__label__2 " A Good Fun Guide to Swedish: I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided."
__label__1 " Rather outdated Swedish: I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resv�skan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
__label__1 " Helpful ? Not so much: Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas."

__label__2 " The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore: Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."

A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy."
__label__1 " bad version to read: The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem."
__label__1 " Too bad I bought this book.: I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment)."
__label__1 " A Good Translation but still disappointed: This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
__label__1 Kindle edition formatting is horrible!: The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible.
__label__1 " Don't buy the Kindle edition: This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."
__label__2 " Narrative poetry at its best very comical: Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."
__label__2 " A good translation.: The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."
__label__2 " A Review: The Canterbury Tales was a notably written book,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect story. It was very interesting to read this book and I reccommend it for any others who like to read short little tales as are in this book."
__label__2 " Children's Version! Not for the literary afficianado...: I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation."
__label__2 " The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue: This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well."
__label__2 Recommend this seller: I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller.
__label__2 " Chaucer appeals to everyone: The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging."
__label__1 " The Canterbury Tales by a modern hack poet: This set of CDs is a fraud! Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a ""translation"" by some hack poet. So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you. But it is definitely not Chaucer."
__label__1 " Why is Chaucer so great?: Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least."
__label__1 " Wait long enough and anything becomes a ""classic"": Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."
__label__1 " For Simpsons fans.: If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
__label__2 " Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast: At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking."
__label__2 " Classic: In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers ""Canterbury Tales"". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."
__label__2 " It's a very through pocket book that can guide you in Laos: This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. I purchased this book in order to learn the language at a quicker and more simplified pace. It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well. Even though studying an entirely new language can be laborious, Mr. Cummings has made it easy for anyone to be bilingual, even multi-lingual."
__label__1 " transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around."
__label__1 " insufficient to teach this tonal language: this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."
__label__1 " No Lao-to-English!: This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
__label__1 " Yawn De Florette: This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film."
__label__2 " Beautiful and touching: I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/book I've ever seen/read. I love this story so much because it is so absolutely realistic and that it is human nature to do what a lot of the characters in the film did. There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book? (I read the French version)."
__label__2 " A Feast for the Eyes and Ears: Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight."
__label__2 " Great story !: The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot)."
__label__1 " Wonderful Movie...Bad Transfer: Since purchasing a DVD player a year and a half ago, I have often come across reviews that bemoan the ""transfer quality"" of a particular title. Now...I know what they are talking about.While this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I was extremely disappointed in the picture and sound quality. Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the ""transfer"" 1 star. Since this is not likely to be re-released as a ""Special Edition"" I would reluctantly recommend buying this title, only because it will have a longer shelf life than the VHS edition."
__label__2 " Definitely worth watching, although the lesser of two parts.: Although new to French Cimema, this film has introduced me to some wonderful acting and cinematography. The set is impressive and the music is memorable.Having watched Jean de Florette first, I believe it warrants five stars of it's own accord. Manon des Sources is far superior, but there aren't many films that hold a candle to Manon, foreign language or otherwise.I certainly agree that this has to be seen to appreciate Manon. With these two films being one of the rarities in film making, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
__label__2 " WOW!: As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs."
__label__1 " Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo: I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space."

__label__2 " The closest thing to time travel: This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."
__label__1 " Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here!: I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."
__label__1 " Interested in the great ship? Don't look here.: I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works."
__label__1 " 1986 NOT 1912: If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend ""The Night Lives On"" by Walter Lord."
__label__1 " False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.: Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
__label__1 " The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......: The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book."
__label__1 " Awful book: This book was horrible. I've read many books on Titanic, and this has to be the worst. If you want to read a good book, check outA Night to Rememberor getTitanic: An Illustrated HistoryHalf of this book deals with the finding of the ship in '85. I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic."
__label__1 " Not the best: I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron's film. Many of the ""facts"" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it. It almost seems as if he is trying to convince everyone that he was a co-discoverer of Titanic and Robert Ballard's best friend. I would recommend another author, one who actually has a love for Titanic and isn't trying to make himself look better."
__label__1 This book is auful !!: If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it. Much of the information is wrong (Frank Tower ??? PLEASE !) The authors reliance on foul language to make his point ... all of this makes this book an annoying piece of trash unfit for anyone to read !
__label__1 False: I'm am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built.(in my opinion)And this book was very in accurate. The authors didn't really focus on what really happened. If I were a critic I'd give it... two thumbs WAY DOWN!
__label__2 " New facts learned and old ones enlightened: When I first saw this book in my local book store about a year ago, I thought: Great, another book on the Titanic giving the same old facts and the same stories that every book on the Titanic contain. But then I picked it up and started reading, I learned about the more about the feelings of the officers and crew that night and the feelings of the men who found her. Although the book jumps around a bit, it was still enjoyable to read."
__label__2 " Pellegrino is the best.: I love Charles Pellegrino. I read this book four years ago and have read other books by him which possess the same brilliant scientific analyses yet contain an intimacy of the subject rarely found in nonfictional books. I could easily imagine standing beside him looking over the water in sorrow. Although the movie was truly outstanding, it cut some of the most crucial scenes out (the radio controllers). READ the book to find out what the movie missed!!"
__label__2 " Enlightening and spell binding: I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"

__label__2 " Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!"
__label__2 " Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
__label__2 " a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion: Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
__label__1 " A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.: The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state.

It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!"
__label__2 " Great Bed....Except for a Demon Dog: This bed is great, but since my dog is a puppy and has decided to destroy everything in sight - I had to take it from him to salvage what I could in hopes he will settle down with age. He has already destroyed my soaker hose around the foundation of my house, most of my plants, my sprinklers, a lot of the siding on my house....and more (the swings never had a chance). I think this thing is great and looks like it will work well, but I will have to wait to hopefully get its full use. One of th great things about it is that it has the cedar in it to prevent bugs and stuff from getting on him. I just have to hope this destruction phase will end soon. Enjoy....."

The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."

It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the ""F"" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."
__label__1 This movie was trite.: The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
__label__1 " Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars."
__label__1 " pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist."
__label__1 " EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!: I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire."
__label__2 Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!: Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen. You won't be disapointed if you see it. The actors and actress' are wicked!i give it 2 Thumbs up
__label__1 " Hate widescreen format: Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format."
__label__1 " I want my money back: This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special. Save your money and treat yourself to a Big Mac meal. It will go down easier than the characters in this movie."
__label__1 Boring: My friend likes this movie so I checked it out. I didn't like it. Kind of boring. Couldn't get through the whole thing. Fastforward solved the problem :)
__label__2 " Birthday present for my niece.: My niece specifically requested this movie for her birthday. She loves the movie! It was exactly what she wanted (of course, she asked for it, duh!)"
__label__2 GREAT DANCING: The story line for this movie was different - something new - which I believe we all need in this day!The dancing & music was great - I have the sound track and I have the movie in DVD and watch it alot. It's just great and Piper is wonderful.I'd love to see a sequel...........
__label__2 " Surprise! A good story: This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching."
__label__2 Loved it: Don't know why but can't stop watching this movie. Love the story and the setting of the film
__label__2 Entertaining: I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
__label__2 Great movie!: We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!
__label__2 " GOOD LOOKIN'!!: My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
__label__1 " Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad..............: Wow. This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything."
__label__1 " Just another pretty face: This movie deserves every harsh review it gets. However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie. If you have a brain and like to use it, this movie is probably not for you. What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff."
__label__2 Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
__label__1 " A unique torture-technique: I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon."
__label__1 " If only I could convince my wife: I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another ""Flashdance,"" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."
__label__1 " Unnecessary...: Hoping this ""unrated"" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent ""unrated"" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a ""harder"" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of ""Coyote Ugly"" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick."
__label__1 " These chicks think they're so cool and tough: Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience. Stupid women."
__label__1 " Total cheese-fest: I can't believe movies like this get made! This movie is CHEESY from start to finish. The characters are empty, the plot is thin, and the cliches are in abundance. Buy/rent this movie only if you want to laugh at the money you just wasted."
__label__1 " men are pigs: This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked."
__label__1 " Sexist film: Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today."
__label__1 " Not worth buying...a renter at best: A plot and story that has been done before, better. Miserably bad acting: Tara Banks, Leanne Rymes. Only highlight: John Goodman. Better yet, rent something else."
__label__2 " Cool, sexy and wild...: This is one of my favorite movies ever! It is a good story,a story that tell us to follow our dreams... I just say 1 thing to all the people that had [not] seen the movie... SEE IT!! It is just fabulous."
__label__1 Dumb movie: This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
__label__2 Enjoy: I really enjoyed this movie and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd. It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on.
__label__1 " How pitiful: I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of movies. When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn't very excited about it. But ""what the heck, I'll watch anything once."" First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I'm sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that's about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys."
__label__2 " Excellent Movie!: When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!"
__label__2 I love this movie: This product is really great for my trip. It also came in early and I am enjoying the movie.
__label__2 " One of the Best movies I Have Ever Seen: I have watched this movie with my daughter about a million times over the last 5 years, and I can honestly say that it never gets old! The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman's finest performance. The movie will leave you feeling warm at heart over and over again. The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city. There is nothing in the movie that has a WOW factor to it, but that doesnt retract anything from the story to me. If you haven't seen it, you could do a lot LOT worse than to buy this movie."
__label__2 " I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!: I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!"
__label__2 " More true than most people realize: As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want."
__label__1 " too much gyrating and not enought interest for me: Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia."
__label__1 Iz love Tira but this is still abd: really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
__label__2 An Inspiration!!: This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.......and i do not care what you other people say about it!! A young song writer goes into the big NYC to sell her music and struggles without much money till she finds out about a bar needing some work......COYOTE UGLY!......finally she is making money and falling in love with an Australian Hottie....the rest is for you to see......i loved the story line of this movie....it makes anyone want to go out and reach their goals and dreams!........TWO THUMBS UP!
__label__1 " Cringeworthy.: Viewed: 2/06Rate: 32/06: Coyote Ugly displayed a fair story that made my skin to crawl. A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations."
__label__1 " sticky sweet, predictable...: I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable. 30 minutes into it, I almost changed the channels. But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every ""twist"" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better."
__label__1 " Make it Stop!: My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"
__label__1 A nightmare!: I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
__label__2 good movie: I liked the movie I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first movie I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed.
__label__2 " Love this movie: One of my all time favorite movies. Quality of viewing was very poor, but Amazon was extremely helpful and refunded my price. Would try to rent again!"
__label__2 this is jerseys movie: piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. she is an empowering actress and deserves an academy award nomination. the whole cast is great though. this movie is excellent.
__label__1 " Special effects?!: Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again."
__label__1 " This is a 2 star movie if you're not a girl and under 16: This movie is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls. The guy in this movie does one of the worst acting jobs Ive ever seen, and nothing ever really happens. If you have a good taste for movies, then you shouldnt like this movie. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a ""cute"" story, but thats about it. (Also, no bar like that is going to have only 1 bouncer, gimme a break!)"
__label__2 Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
__label__1 " excruciating...: I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, ""Look how cute and adorable I am."" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."
__label__2 " Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???"
__label__1 " Good intentions... Horrible execution.: Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
__label__1 Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
__label__1 " A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the ""Frat Boy"" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the ""small town girl goes to the big city"" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the ""T"" & ""A"".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the ""acting"" is better on those cable shows."
__label__1 " Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever."
__label__2 " Coyote Ugly ROCKS!: Coyote Ugly is one of the best movies i've seen so far. When i walked out of the theatre after watching Coyote Ugly, i was like ""WOW! That was a really good movie"". The actors are fantastic, cinematography was good, on top of that, the SOUNDTRACK is really really cool. I immediately went to the stores to get the soundtrack to the movie. Some people think that this movies has a lot of ""sexual"" content, but i think it's nothing more than just a few pretty ladies in nice looking outfits having the time of their lives. This movies is a MUST-WATCH and certainly worth the money to get it. Trust me, it's really fantastic."
__label__1 " i hated this movie: I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well."
__label__2 " Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie."
__label__1 " Another tax-loss movie?: You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."
__label__1 " Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.: I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother."
__label__2 " A Great Sexy Movie!: All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
__label__2 " It's Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
__label__1 " Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."
__label__1 " Bruckheimer Should Stick With ""Guy"" Movies...: I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to ""The Big City"" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."
__label__2 " Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness."
__label__1 " One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing..."
__label__1 really weak Film: nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
__label__1 " Stage Fright Is Not Genetic: Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure."
__label__2 " Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.: This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what ""Queer"" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."
__label__2 " Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2.0: Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: ""Push It,"" ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,"" ""Temptation Waits,"" ""Special"" Rating: 8/10"
__label__2 " Great CD: Definitely my favorite band. We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more."
__label__2 " I can't get enough of this 'garbage': Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."
__label__2 " A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans: This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. Such, direct and bold songs as ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""Pust It"", and ""When I Grow Up"" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive!"
__label__2 Not as good as the first: With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
__label__2 " Is anybody here rating the Tab book instead of the album?: Great album. Always was, always will be, one of my favorites. Went looking for a guitar tab book on Amazon. Found one that said it had 542 reviews for it. Opened a review; not about the book, about the album. Opened another, and another, and another, you get the picture. Nice going Amazon."
__label__2 One of best pop/rock cds: Garbage is here again!!!! This cd is (little) better than the first and is worth buying. This cd is little old but I listen to it as I listen to newer cds. It is one of my best cds.
__label__2 " I LOVE THIS CD!!!: I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"
__label__2 " garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,: kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to ""the trick is to keep breathing"". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to ""BIG DADDY"""
__label__2 " One of the best C.D.'s I've heard in a long time!!!!: This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__2 I want to be Shirley Manson!: This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great.
__label__2 I love this CD!!! It's awsome!!!!: I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!
__label__2 One of the best CD's of 1998!: Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!
__label__2 " Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.: Garbage rules so much, it's impossible to describe in words. Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There are over twenty-five so far, and still much more to come, I'm sure. I don't need to use the playlist function on my CD players--I can listen to each. Besides Version 2.0, buy every other one they have out! ""I think I'm Paranoid"", ""Only Happy When it Rains"", ""Stupid Girl"", and ""13x Forever""(""13x Forever"" is only on the ""Special"" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. You have to hear them. GUFFYPUP'S APPROVAL RATING (1-10): 26"
__label__2 " This CD ROCKS !!! This CD is GREAT GARBAGE !!!: Listen folks, you want a GREAT CD ! Garbage is version 2.0 is IT! This is one of thje BEST CDs I have purchased in a long time and my very 1st from AMAZON ! What a great price and service ! I work for a company involved in the design and creation of home and commercial theater, etc. I took this CD in the day I received it and let me tell you, what a demo ! We were all ready to party ! 500 QUALITY watts, 2 SUBS,5 Channels ! Thought we would crack the cement floor ! I have never purchased a CD like this with such cool tunes on ALL TRACKS. Keep on a rockin Garbage ! RKNM (Rockenem) in Portage WIsconsin !"
__label__2 " There are only a couple of tracks that aren't brill!!: Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'"
__label__2 " version 2.0-newer, faster, better: after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!"
__label__2 " This CD rules!: I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."
__label__2 " The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. And not only to hear it. I bought it immidiately. It is one of the last (or perhaps, the first?) bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound. Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" or ""You Look So Fine""), sometimes they sound angry (""I think I'm Paranoid""), but all the songs that are here get along really well. In spite of all the differences between the songs, the album sounds consistent. Energy, joy, sadness, tenderness, love, hate. What else does anyone want from music?"
__label__2 " I liked it much more that the first CD...: I've enjoyed this CD so much! I bought ""Garbage"" and really liked it. Then my friend bought me ""Version 2.0"". I'm really impressed with the instrumentation and the lyrics. I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!!!"
__label__1 " Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band.: Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore."
__label__1 " Weak...: Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak."
__label__1 " Garbage is exactly that......: I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at ""art rock"" BORING"
__label__1 " Ditch the Producer: Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. ""2.0"" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."
__label__1 " Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available."
__label__1 one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.
__label__2 " You Betta Buy This!: What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff. Wonderful melodies, brash sounds, singalong hooks, and you can dance to it too. Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM!"
__label__2 " Absolutely Outstanding: I must admit that I'm addicted to ""Version 2.0."" The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player. Described by Shirley Manson herself as ""mongrel-esque,"" the band's style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment."
__label__2 " warning: this CD is extremely addictive: All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
__label__2 " Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. ""Special"" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), ""Push It"" and ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."
__label__2 " I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is ""When I Grow Up."" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."
__label__1 I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. My rating? I'll give version 2.0 a C+ for a good attempt
__label__1 " I was disappointed: Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are."
__label__2 " Garbage-Version 2.0: This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be ""Special"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". ""When I Grow Up"" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"
__label__2 " I'm a Garbage addict.... and this rocks!: This is the best CD I've ever heard! Once again, Shirley rocks on with those dark tunes. But this seemed a little happier-especially ""When I grow Up"" and ""Special""-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! This is certainly ""Special""!"
__label__2 " Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
__label__2 " Temptation Waits...: After a great debut, garbage made an album that made pop world better. With the songs like ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", ""Special"", ""Temptation Waits"", and a slow ballad ""You Look So fine"" they conquered the music world. Shirley Manson's voice was so great although a sad one...and a little bit creepy. The lyrics are quite creepy too. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine"
__label__2 " One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" and most of all the sparkling ""Special."" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like ""Hammering in My Head"" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever."
__label__2 " THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE.: This CD is a wonderful outstanding effort. My only worry is that they put all their eggs in one basket....How can they do better than this one? Every song is a wonder of its own. My favorites ""Special"", and ""Temptation Waits"". In my opinion this should of won as best CD of the year at the grammies over Lauryn Hill handsdown. Don't miss this one."
__label__2 " Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track ""Temptation waits"" reminded me a lot of the power that ""Supervixon"" had, & ""Special"" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks."
__label__2 " OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. GET IT!!! Or if you are repelled@by the negative comments of others, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE FIRST!!!!@If you are going to read a book read Dangerous Angels: The Weetzie Bat books by Francesca Lia Block!"
__label__2 " Garbage is the best Glam Rock band!: Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. Their mix of heavy techno and heavy alternative rock makes this band unique and special..oh yes by the track on this CD. Very good CD, Garbage is original and great to rock out to and also to mellow out to...buy the CD!"
__label__2 " good cd: this is a really good cd. i think that the song "" i think i'm paranoid "" is a funny song. and the rest of the cd is great"
__label__2 I agree: ... with all the other glowing reviews. I just want to add ... this is great headphone music! Put on this CD and some really good bass-boost stereo headphones. You will be blissed-out!
__label__2 " Garbage Is Anything But...: While I only give Blondie 5 stars, Garbage is my next all-time favorite band! This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like ""Special"" and ""Push It"" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!"" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!"
__label__2 " More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: ""I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.""Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly ""Push It"" and ""Special"", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: ""Temptation Waits"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Medication"", and ""You Look So Fine.""Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."
__label__2 " Great CD!: I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!"
__label__2 " I never get tired of it!: Not many cd's can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Version 2.0, however, is one of the elite few who will have you praying for Garbage's next cd! So every one, go out there and buy this cd cause it has to be the best I have ever heard!"
__label__2 " Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!: if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
__label__1 " Changed too much in too little time.: The band tried to pioneer a little too much into dance and electronica too early. Though ""The Trick..."" was the only good song with their new sound, ""Hammering..."" and ""Sleep Together"" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of ""Special"" and ""The Trick..."" and go from there."
__label__1 Paranoiac...: This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
__label__2 Love this CD!: I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
__label__2 " You gotta love garbage: After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
__label__2 " if ya like the first one, you're gonna love this!!!!: This is a great CD and all I can say is that if you're a fan of the first album....you have to get this one."
__label__2 " Good: I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
__label__2 " pertty good: I do enjoy this ablum and would recommend it. I am not sure if it will be found to be as strong as some of their other music, however, it you are a Garbage fan, I think this will work for you."
__label__2 " the best album on the market: i started out taping garbage songs off the radio, till i figured out i could get them all on a cd. so i bought it & i still play it non stop. wherever i am in the house, its playing. i actually bought this before their first album, but i havent been disappointed in any of their music. this is an album you can let play through, without ever wanting to skip. my favs are ""when i grow up"" and ""temptation waits"", but they kinda rotate depending on my mood. this cd has a song for every mood, so go buy it now, you won't be disappointed."
__label__2 " Great CD by a great group.: This is a great CD. Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD. Songs like ""Temptation Waits"", ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"", ""Sleep Together"" and others really show off the quality of this group in a way you would otherwise not know. If you like what you've already heard from Garbage, you really need this CD, you will not be disappointed."
__label__2 " An amazing follow-up...: I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better."
__label__2 " THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!: This CD is the bomb. GET IT! It's much more organized than the first. Garbage is unique, compared to other bands. I love this CD. It is my life. HELP I""M A SHIRLEY MANSON WANNABE! I love you garbage!! I'm telling you guys, if you don't get this, you are missing out on SOOOO much!GET IT!"
__label__2 " New Type of Funk: new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here."
__label__2 " GREAT ,BRILLIANT ,SUPER!: I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it.First thing I can say is that this album is one of the best albums in the world!All the songs are great and I cannot spend a day without listening to it.Shirley's vocal performance is perfect as usual!After listening to Garbage's albums the other albums don't give me the same pleasure.GARBAGE is surely the best band in the universe for me and the members are really great people!I'm sure they will continue their success with their 3rd Album and if I was going to a deserted island, one of the 3 things that I'd take would be VERSION 2.0 (the others would be the batteries and my CD player for listening to it :))"
__label__2 " A very ""Special"" album.: I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."
__label__2 " Garbage is great!: Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like ""Stupid Girl"" ""Queer"" or ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is ""Temptation Waits."" ""Hammering in my Head"" is great, too. The most popular ones, ""Push It"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."
__label__2 " Just when you think it couldn't get any better.: I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs. A perfect application for parties, driving and getting things done.I'll wear this disc into a coaster in no time."
__label__2 sticky: Garbage did it again! Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower.
__label__2 " Don't forget to take out this Garbage!: I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."
__label__2 " AWESOME!: Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed."
__label__2 " I loved every minute of the cd: I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album."
__label__2 " this CD rocks!: This album is wonderful.I must tell you the first time I listened to it, I loved every single song on the disc.The lyrics are catchey and the beats are incredible!Buy this CD and you will NOT be wasting your money!"
__label__2 " Now THIS is music!: Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man. I'm so happy I have it + it exists."
__label__2 " One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !: Truly the best album I've ever listen to. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. I love Shirley's voice, its sultry and seductive, and she really rocks. All the tracks are great! Go out and buy it! Its definitely worth it."
__label__2 " ""Special"" CD: This is a wonderful CD, Shirley Manson has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. I was hooked the first time I heard them, the songs are great."
__label__2 " An amazing CD. . . the best of '98-'99: Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!"
__label__2 " Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. But Version 2.0 comes very close to the thrill I got from the first CD. It's less ""spooky"" than their freshman effort, but more ""powerful""."
__label__2 " This is the type of 'Garbage' you don't throw away!: Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day."
__label__2 " Adds new fun to the track: The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it."
__label__2 " Good addition to your Brio collection.: Even though it's a bit pricey for what you get, it's a fun addition to your collection. It gives the little engineer another interesting way to manipulate a train, especially battery operated trains. I would recommend buying more than one set/box if you have alot of track - it's fun to keep changing the direction of the trains to make them follow the many different directions of track. I have one set now and plan to buy another."
__label__1 " Not PCI Port: I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
__label__1 " stinks: this thing smells and transfers the smell to your hands. very chemical like poisonous odor. put it in a cotton sock until this comes, then will throw it away.IMAK Stress Ball, Grey (Pack of 4)"
__label__2 " A good season: I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."
__label__1 " Terrible season. Terrible stories.: First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6."
__label__1 cheaper at target: I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....
__label__2 This was a Great buy and a good shipment!: I recommend this product and i had no problem with the company that it came from. It got here on time and in Great shape.
__label__1 One Tree Hill Season 7: This was a good product overall. it was just bad quality. it seemed like it was burned off of an original. Every disk says disk 1 the title scene is blurry and parts of the episodes are pretty choppy.
__label__1 BOOTLEG: The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. Super annoyed and disappointed with my purchase. . . .
__label__2 One Tree Hill: Anyone can get into this show. For all ages. It's very addicting and i wish it never ended. Worst part is Chad leaving
__label__2 One Tree Hill: Great cast. Great episodes. Great price. I love every single episode from this series. sad to see it come to an end.
__label__1 " So Corny.: First, I want to say I watched the entire season and have seen the entire series. This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money."
__label__2 One Tree Hill Season 7: This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international.Package was not damaged in the slightest and ive enjoyed watching every second of this season as it has not yet been released on DVD in Aus yet.Good work!
__label__2 very satisfied: The quality of the product was perfect. Brand new. It was sent out it two days. I was very satisfied.
__label__2 Very pleased: No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
__label__2 " Love this show!: I love this show, I bought this season to complete my collection. They have made the boxed set boxes a lot smaller in size over time, but still packed with all the great episodes of this fantastic show!"
__label__2 " Guardian Heroes 2 vs. Sega Saturn guardian Heroes: All in all this game is amazing!!!I'm sure all yuo old school sega fans out there know what I'm talking about. The ground breaking genre defining Guardian Heroes!orgionally, the first Guardian Hero game came out on the legendary sega saturn and there was and still is nothing like it. If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game! It was a bit sad to know that they've all died, but it was absolutely a must for the developing storyline.If you've played the first one I'm sure you'll agree the way the story goes is PERFECT! I wish I could give this game 10 stars...Long Live Prince Valgar!!!"
__label__2 " Not long enough: This game is fast paced and action packed. All the moves are easy, the versus mode is fun, controls are tight. 2 minor complaints: The game is too short, and the music leaves a little to be desired. But you'll be too busy fighting hordes of enemies to notice."
__label__1 " Crappy Guardian Villains: Do you want a game that makes you frustrated? Do you want a game that gives you an excuse to throw your GBA at a wall and hit it with a hammer? Do you want a game, that makes you bang your head on a wall over and over again? If so, buy the game! If not, oh sweet mary do buy it! Please do not buy this! Please! This game is self-proclaimed to be a difficlulty level for children. You would need to have the devotion of a Shaolin Monk to master this game! It's soooo fricking hard! It's like trying to play Mario Party 4 while having a seizure. THe Japanese to English translations are terrible! The story make no sense, like all japanese games. There is this ""soul of hero"" trying to fight ""the choas"". Oh and If you die, you either get to use your soul to revive you to the last check-point, or trade in your soul for ""Devil Mode"". ""Devil Mode"" is when you get unlimited hp and magic for 6 minutes and you die. THis game isn't worth your time, or money."
__label__2 Jula Bell gives me shivers: This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Cudos to Kent. My favorite part is the final cut by underground artist Jula Bell. I was so pleased to hear her singing on something like this. Cheers to Kent for having the guts to take a chance with someone who is a truly cutting edge artist known for her integrity. I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his. It's simplicity and bold melody is the heart and soul of the soundtrack. Why wasn't this song in the movie? Buy this cd to hear one of the best female vocalists out there---
__label__2 " Sting's the Star: The majority of cuts on the CD are run of the mill soundtrack fair. That being said, the CD is worth the purchase price for ""Until"" written and performed by Sting. I predict it will become an ageless favorite!"
__label__2 " A Must for Kate & Leopold fans: The music on this cd is a lot like the movie...different, but with a great romantic edge to it. The only thing is that to enjoy it, you need to like music with no words that can put a picture in your mind...this does exactly that. If you loved the movie, I would DEFINATELY recomend this cd."
__label__2 " Excellent!: The soundtrack for ""Kate and Leopold"" is an excellent one, and the beautiful and dreamy musical segments evoke warm and happy memories of the delightful film and the scenes which are represented by the music.I am very happy to have bought this CD."
__label__1 " Not worth the money: The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song.Spend your money on something else or buy a whole cd of sting, not justy one song.You will be glad you did."
__label__2 Great Game for Young Kids: My kids ages 5 (boy) and 8 (girl) love this game! They are obsessed... It is the one that has been able to keep their attention more than any other so far.
__label__1 It didn't work.: It didn't work. I was excited that it came in fast. but the game does not work. it made my kids sad. Waste of money. I do not recommend buying this game. First time it happened to me. Good luck if you decide to buy it.
__label__1 " Amazon duped. Me too.: This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
__label__1 Pac Man World 2: I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it
__label__2 " Jane Fonda in ""Julia"": I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave shine in their roles in this excellent film based on Lillian Hellman's true life experience during war time. Fonda is at her best in this film playing Lillian Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave won an Academy Award for her performance as Julia. It is a movie not to be missed by serious film buffs."
__label__1 Be aware!: This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
__label__1 " Julia: I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not."
__label__1 I don't understand all the hype over this: Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
__label__2 " Compelling, wonderful film: I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."
__label__2 " What happened to this DVD?: The date says January 1, 2010. Anyone know what happened to prevent this from coming out today, June 7, 2005, as originally planned?"
__label__2 " Continuing enjoyment through the years: This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD."
__label__1 fun at first but will get boring: only the first case is fun and the rest are stupid. dont waste your money on this game like i did
__label__2 " Wow.: This collection of short stories is destined to be a classic and a ""must-have"" for people everywhere. Take a look at yourself and at your fellow man. This book is great from cover to cover."
__label__1 " I like the idea, BUT...: As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
__label__1 yoga for surfers: don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
__label__1 Dont buy: This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
__label__2 " Wow!: Yoga For Surfers is one of the best DVDs I own! I am convinced it is by far, the best yoga tape. Even as a beginner, I can see how it has helped me become more flexible and with such amazing surfing and how radiant Peggy is on-screen, I can't help but get inspired every time I watch it!"
__label__2 " Amazing!: For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it."
__label__1 " Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
__label__2 " Great DVD: This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.Works great before my surf sessions. I just hope to be able to do the poses all the way soon. It's a great way to start my day."
__label__1 " Yoga For Sufers Review: As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice."
__label__1 " Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class."
__label__2 " I Love this Video: I love this video -- everything about it is so true. Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses. The music is enchanting and adds to the uplifting nature of the program. And the quality of this video is the best I have ever seen - gorgeous surf and beach scenes and top-notch editing between the poses. I recommend this video to everyone!"
__label__1 " Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying."
__label__1 " PLEASE READ: This book does NOT contain a book key. I returned one and the next one didnt have it either. The OLC passcode card is nothing either. The card says that ""code is no longer necessary"". Basically this is a like new book with no extra features. Buy used!"
__label__2 very helpful: I have found this to be a very helpful workbook to go with Que Tal text. The answers are in the back for self check. It incorporates the vocab of the chapter with the grammar covered.
__label__2 " Night Vision: The standard lighting (headlights) on our 2001 Ford Ranger was disappointing. As you get older, you come to appreciate better lighting and the factory headlamps are poor. I tried the better bulbs from NAPA without a great improvement. Finally, I ordered the PIAA's and they represent a great improvement; they seem like twice the illumination of standard lighting. I only wish they were available in""off road"" strength."
__label__2 " Bright white: Installed these on my 2001 F-150 WOW a Big difference even in big city lights night driving, these bulbs really perform well."
__label__2 xtreme white plus bulbs: the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
__label__1 Save your money: These are not as bright as the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra and cost a whole lot more. They do not perform as advertised.
__label__2 I like em!: Put a set of PIAA headlamps on my Ford Ranger and woke up the night! Not too bright as to annoy on coming traffic but waaay better than the stock lights.Big Jim Miller
__label__1 " Not enough bag for the buck: I have 2 2005 Dodge pickups the factory headlights suck, I bought a pair of these for one of the trucks. I have to say they are brighter then the factory bulbs. The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs."
__label__1 " Disappointed: With the cost of these bulbs I was expecting a WOW when I turned them on, but only got a very slight improvement from the previous bulbs. Maybe it's because their in an old Dodge Intrepid which are know to have poor light design. But I was really hoping for an improvement. I run them on high beam all the time just to be able to see at night, and no one has ever flash their lights at me."
__label__1 " PIAA are whiter: There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn't to impressed. After driving with them I could notice an improvement over regular lamps."
__label__2 " An Essential For CD Mixer's!!: This double volume CD is a great tool for the begginer and experts DJ who mixes CDs. Since CD mixing is still fairly modern it is hard to find good loops, beats, scratches, and effects. Simmon Harris has put together a wide range of beats for DJ's to use. Each track includes the BPM (beats per minute), a very helpfull feature that you won't find too often.

__label__2 awsume: i got this just it time to winterize our camper its better than draining all the water and replacing with anti freeze.. used it to blow out all water then just poured a little down the drains.. good price and shipping was fast..
__label__2 Rugged!: Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.
__label__2 " This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure. That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex. This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again."
__label__1 " Too Restrictive to allow air volume needed.: Plug has a tiny hole that is too restrictive to allow enough air volume through to do an adequate job. Hole may be small to attempt ""reduce"" pressure but that is not a satisfactory way to reduce pressure anyway. Need to reduce pressure on compressor regulator to avoid blowing out lines in RV Make you own adapter using a piece of garden hose, and the appropriate adapters to do a satisfactory job of removing all water from you RV lines for winter storage."
__label__2 " A great book with lots of room for improvements.: I have experiences in many martial arts and had done lots of streetfighting, and I can tell a working technique just by looking at pictures. In this sense, I must say that 75% of Prof. Kirby's moves works well. His armlocks, for example, are more effective than those of Aikido. However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books."
__label__1 " Impractical: The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's, or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy, maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art, this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests, but not for serious self-defense.In fact, this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you're a student of the author, of course. I'd hate to see what the ""Basic"" book is like, and as funny as this particular book is, it's not worth the money to buy it, even for a good laugh."

When Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, finds herself desperate for protection for both herself and her people from an ex-Knight of the Round Table, she turns to King Arthur to save them all.Guinevere's decision - to marry the king, leads her into danger and intrigue as she begins the wildest journey of her life.When Lancelot saves an unknown lady in the forest, both their hearts become engaged. Lancelot becomes a friend and trusted confidant to the King, and Guinevere becomes Arthur's wife. While fighting to keep their love at bay, war threatens to tear them apart forever.Chadwick's love of re-enactment becomes apparent in this wonderful story of forbidden love. She describes everything in such striking detail; the reader can almost smell the stench of burning straw or feel the adrenaline and fear accompanying battle. This book is a must read, though not quite as powerful as many of Chadwick's other novels."
__label__2 " First Knight (Cassette): Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."
__label__2 " One of my all time favorite books back in print!: A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up. My mom, an elementary school teacher, used to read it to her class every year. I have since purchased two used paperback versions of the book for my grandchildren, and I'm so happy to see it is being reprinted. I highly recommend this book for adults and children. It's a one-evening read for an adult, but I promise you will enjoy it."

__label__2 " A tribute to the abilities of the WWII small carrier.: A ""must read"" for anyone interested in the WWII carrier navy, R.Adm. Gallery relates the tedium of service in Iceland, the terror of being stalked by German U-boats in the North Atlantic, capped off with the true-adventure tale of his Carrier Task Group's *capture* of the German U-boat 505 (now on display in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry) off the African coast. D.V.

__label__2 " A real-life lesson in leadership: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book."

__label__2 " I find that Jeff Gold music is exceedingly uplifting!!: I own two CD's by Jeff Gold: ""Escapes"", and ""The Soul of the Mountain"". I find that his music is exceedingly uplifting, and after listening to his music colors seem to brighten and the belief in goodness is restored. (I especially enjoyed his compositions, ""Del Playa"" and ""The Soul of the Mountain"".) J.Gold is a gifted composer by any standard and he is unparalleled when it comes to writing music that has a healing effect on the psyche. I highly recommend Jeff Gold Music to Everyone!"
__label__2 Dr. Barnett's newest edition to a timeless classic: In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A. Barnett gives us this enlightened book to show us step by step the way that we can turn the key and free ourselves through the use of analytical hypnotherapy. The chapter on self hypnosis has taught me great relaxation skills. I have been a fan of this book for over 15 years and find it as relative today as it was when it was first published. This newest version comes with a wonderful new cover design and clean crisp text. Wonderfully written to be easily understood by both the student of hypnosis and the average reader. Well worth the asking price.
__label__1 OMG!!!: One of the top 10 worst books ever. Waded through 100 pages and decided life is way too short to waste it reading this gibberish. AVOID!!!!!
__label__2 " You'll ease your stress if you use the advice in this book: Jim and John have a wonderful way of making you feel like you're sitting down at your kitchen table with a bankruptcy attorney who only has your best interests at heart. They don't pull any punches, and sometimes what they tell you isn't what you really want to hear, but you know they're giving you solid advice. Your anxiety level will plummet if you are thinking of filing bankruptcy and are looking for someone to hold your hand through the process.Paula Langguth Ryan, Author, Bounce Back From Bankruptcy, 3rd Edition"
__label__2 " I think that its a good book: Anthony's works are all easy to read and the world of xanth draws you in automatically; I guess its the bookworm's equivalent of junk food--not nourishing for your literary education but satisfying nothenless. This book was one of the ""better"" books of Xanth--although i have yet to find one that didn't leave me rolling on the floor and lauging. Its fun reading about a barbarian...they aren't the typical main chracter after all and its interesting how Piers Anthony manages to make something fearsome seem silly and human."
__label__1 " One of those addicting Xanth novels.: Once you start reading Xanth novels, they become addicting. This one is not as addicting as some of the series"
__label__1 " What were they thinking?: Seriously, I am quite the fantasy reader. However, this piece of dribble should not have ever been published. It is one of the WORST books I have ever read- in any genre. No plot or charecter development, nothing. If you want good fantasy, go read one of the DRAGONLANCE titles."
__label__1 " Noddy Songs from Toyland: The CD cover shows the 'performer as Noddy'. However, the songs are sung by various artists. They liked the songs, but my grandchildren were disappointed. They thought they would hear the voices heard on the DVD's."
__label__2 " ORDOR GONE: This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it."
__label__2 " Del Shannon Shines: Del Shannon wrote some of the most distributing and depressing songs in rock music. The eerie landscapes and sounds of songs like the classic ""Runaway"", ""Hats Off to Larry"", ""Keep Searchin' (Follow the Sun)"", ""Little Town Flirt"" & ""Stranger In Town"" speak of true heartache and despair. The sound that Mr. Shannon created was original and nothing before or since has quite matched the moodiness of these songs."
__label__1 Read as fiction: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
__label__2 " Worked Great.: I had bought this some time ago, but never used it. Recently I had been having memory card errors on my Canon Camera. I decided to try the 4 in 1 cleaner and it solved my error problems"
__label__2 Great little tool: I bought this because of errors on my Nikon camera to see if cleaning the contacts for the compact flash card would correct the issue. One cleaning and the errors are going. I'm going to use this to make sure all my cards are getting a clean contact with the device they're in. Pretty great fix if it prevents the need to send the device in to the manufacturer.
__label__1 " A great idea, but...: I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection. It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy. Unfortunately, the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB ""A"" cable end - which is what I really needed. If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that, but not the adapters themselves."
__label__1 " Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.: This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
__label__1 " It could be better: Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all."
__label__2 An unbiased history: One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
__label__1 " Check the facts: I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."
__label__1 " Not real history: This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold."
__label__2 " Lovely Like The Moon: Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon. I feel the same way about the music of Jennifer Warnes. I'm glad to know it's there. Jennifer and her beautiful voice has been such an inspiration to me over the years. I am truly glad that this collection includes her early work. Jennifer's music will stand the test of time, i.e. 20 or 30 years from now people will still be listening to the music of Jennifer Warnes. But you don't have to wait that long. Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song ""all we have is here and now"". So buy it!"
__label__2 Vintage Warnes: A wonderful collection depicting Jennifer's unique talent from early on through her later years! It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Extremely glad I made this purchase!
__label__2 Essential: This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
__label__2 Excellent Recording Artist: Jennifer Warnes has always been a great recording artist and has made some fantastic titles songs for some of the greatest films in the past. She is timeless and this album is a great example of that.
__label__1 " OOPS.... That isn't Jennifer singing on track 18!: The duet with Steve Gillette ( track 18) is actually a recording of another friend of Steve Gillette's, not Jennifer Warnes . How tacky! How could RAVEN have missed that? I had to adjust the volume knob about five or six times. There is an odd ""wow"" falloff at the end of ""These Days"". Sounds like the engineer stopped the turntable manually.Jennifer Warnes was obviously not involved in the creation of this compilation. Too uneven, badly mastered."
__label__2 " This ""Review"" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?"
__label__2 " Great Show - I was there!: Great DVD! I waited 6 hours for front row seats general admission. It was worth the wait. A very HOT show. Not only was Warhol there, but some of the members of the 80's band the Go-Go's, and Adam Ant.In the last song ""Rock & Roll"", they do a 10 second close up of me in the audience playing air guitar. My 15 minutes of fame!Lou is the grandfather of Punk and a classic Rock & Roll ICON. But this disk & enjoy."
__label__1 " sad: a long time lou reed fan was so looking forward to recieving this dvd. if you are entrenched into the talent and feeling and soul of the lou reed album rocknroll animal, you will be so disapointed with this dvd. sweet jane and rocknroll i swear could be played better by a holiday inn cover band. save your money."
__label__2 " This cd is absolutely awesome. Steiner at his best.: I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well."
__label__2 " Great Early Dixie Chicks Single!: ""Goodbye Earl"" was the single that opened my eyes for the Dixie Chicks. This single taken from their first album ""Wide Open Spaces"" is much more ""country"" than ""Earl"", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your ""troubles"" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.""Am I the Only One"" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of ""There's Your Trouble"" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is."
__label__2 " Monster memories: Good Copy of orginal score.The Wolfman is the stronger of the tracks here though Son of Frankenstein is not in the same class as the music from The Bride of Frankenstein is still invokes great moments from the movie.Great for collectors even if they are not horror fans.The Wolfman tracks from the film are the first to be recorded and also includes music that was wrote but never used in the finished movie.Listening to the music from the DVD realeases of the films, you would find it hard pressed to tell the difference if any."
__label__2 " A Great Find!: It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on. A true must-have addition for the classic horror collector!"
__label__2 " IT ""s GREAT ( realy): hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
__label__2 " Examining the Myths: I felt like cheering most of the time as I read this book. Ms. Venker writes so articulately regarding many of the thoughts I have had as a mother, but didn't know how to express. She is thoughtful in her comments and very honest. She doesn't portray motherhood as being totally blissful, but does express the importance of actually parenting your children once you decide to have them. She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices. We need to make sure that our children's needs are our first priority as we make our choices. We can ""have it all"", but maybe not all at the same time. Thank you, Suzanne, for saying what we all need to hear!"
__label__1 " Just because she couldn't do it: Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone."
__label__1 " sad state of affairs: Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH."
__label__1 " Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""?: The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
__label__1 Misguided author: The author is attempting to justify her own choices by putting down working mothers. Do yourself a favor and don't order this book!!
__label__1 " Ideological rant: This book is meant to make working mothers feel guilty while glorifying the stay-at-home mom. Numerous academic studies disprove their thesis--studies that the authors choose to ignore. Read this if you want to reinforce your pre-existing world view. Otherwise, don't bother. There's little factual basis to what they say."
__label__1 " Piece of garbage!: The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else!"
__label__1 What a stupid book!: Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!
__label__1 Leaks: If your drive thru mud and rain expect water to get in this bag. It is not very water resistant.
__label__2 " I love this product: I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. The important feature are pronounciation and quickfind. Just by mouse over the word you can find out the meaning."
__label__1 " Disappointing book. Not what I expected......: Just another book with huge text and lots of wasted space (that makes you think you are getting a lot of reading material).Unfortunately, not much info in this book. If you are looking for a simple, down-to-earth useful book, this really isn't it.Perhaps the other book I ordered, ""Healing Secrets of the Native Americans: Herbs, Remedies, and Practices That Restore the Body, Refresh the Mind, and Rebuild the Spirit"" [Hardcover] will have more useful info. If it ever gets here that is :(My verdict? ""Secrets of Native American Herbal Remedies: comph GT Native amern Tradition Using Herbs Mind/Body/Spirit Connection for ipvg (Healing Arts)"" [Paperback] is a complete waste of money."
__label__2 " GREAT BOOK: Great book very interesting, glad I bought it, and for the rest of the books I've bought, just glancing thru them, they're great, love them all, a couple I have to order more because my daughter loved them and took them home with her...."
__label__1 " Failed expectations: I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America"
__label__2 Bought this as a gift and they are very pleased with it: I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
__label__2 " Great scary read, would be a good movie....: Masterton has done it again. This book surprised me and also scared the hell out of me at times. People in the reviews are complaining about this book being a rip off of other books...give me a break. This has a HP Lovecraft twist but in a Masterton way! He brings out the FLAVOR of it all. the ending was a disappointment with what the character does, but hey, that is life in the real world. If you enjoy a really creepy haunting tale, this one is for you...."
__label__2 " A pretty damn good blood drenched read: PREY isn't Mastertons best, but is entertaining enough. It's in keeping with his usual blend of intelegent horror and all out gore. I loved the book, and read it in next to no time, I dont usually read books twice, but I did this time. OVERVIEW: Intelegent. Bloody. And a great cast.Masterton has again come up with a winner, a page turner. A gore fest that will satisfy even the most thirsty of Horror fans. Pick up a copy, you wont regret it.Nice One Graham.... (Keep writing em.)"
__label__1 " Should characters have brains?: When I first started to read this book, I recognized right away a lot of potential in the story. All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1."
__label__1 " HPL would be spinning: This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's ""Dreams in the Witch House.""It's not a good Masterton book, either. The last 30 pages seem as if he had to get it done fast, or be sued by the publisher.Skip it. ""Spirit"" is a lot better."
__label__1 " Started well, then...: turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book."
__label__2 " IT IS A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CANNOT BE SCARED.: A HORROR BOOK CANNOT GET BETTER THAN THIS;G.M HAS A WAY WITH WORDS TO SCARE THE BEJEE'S OUT OF YOU. HIS STYLE , PROSE AND CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS REFRESHING , ENTERTAINING AND NEVER LACKS TO GRASP YOUR ATTENTION AND INTREST. ANY LADIES THINKING G.M IS A GREAT AUTHOR WRITE TO ME VIA E-MAIL."
__label__2 Pretty: I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.
__label__2 " KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!: Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
__label__2 " Yield, America!: Long you have resisted to Kylie, longer than anyone else on the Planet, but the rocking Krafterwerkish ""La, la, la, la"" will sneak behind you and get into your head. It's shall indeed make all the world move. It just must, it is so damn good. Enjoy Kylie, she's back to make Americans unable to get her out of their heads!!!"
__label__1 " I'll never understand...: When I first heard this song, I laughed. I thought to myself: Who gave her a record deal, she's just plain bad. Than I read a Teen People Article about how she's been around since the 80's, just not in the U.S. But, it didn't change my opinion. Teen People claimed she's bigger than Madonna in the U.K., why? She can hardly sing, her song is bad, I mean, she's not even pretty.Kylie Minogue, is an insult to pop music and a waste of air time on the radio, and that's all."
__label__2 " Great movie!: This is a classic Mary Kate & Ashley movie. The sisters trade places in order to help their dad win the soccer tournament and to help themselves since one sister likes playing soccer more than the other. Their dad in this movie is played by Eric Lutes, who later again stars as their dad in the short lived series So Little Time.This is a great movie for tween girls, I loved every minute of these MK&A; movies when I was a tween!"
__label__1 " The Olsens' movies are just getting more and more pathetic!: I'm very, very sorry to say this, but THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS. THERE IS NO PLOT, NO MORAL LESSON, NO NOTHING. I can understand the part how Sam and Emma switch teams because they were upset with how they were placed, but after that it was like, hello? Where's the rest of the story? The acting was pretty good but the actual plot (or lack of it) totally stunk!"
__label__2 " Robert Clark and the Olsen twins: I saw this movie and i thought that the twins were really good.But,I really like the way that Robert Clark played Helmet Head.Keep showing more movies with him."
__label__2 Really good and even interesting for adult viewing.....: My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!
__label__2 " ""Switching Goals"" is OK...: It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
__label__1 " Too Typical: You think that since these girls had done so many movies, they would have least done something more original than the ""twin"" switch. They would not have been as successful as they are if they were not born twins, but they should still be more creative. I did not like this movie, and the acting was not good at all. It was a huge disappointment."
__label__2 HAPPY: the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.
__label__2 The Best: As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.
__label__1 " Pretentious: Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious."
__label__2 " I didn't fall asleep. That's a good sign!: Okay, I had to read this book for school. From the description on the back I didn't think that it would be very interesting. I was wrong. It held my attention with it's colorful words and characters and kept me guessing about some characters. Anyway, overall it was a very good book. I only wish that the ending was developed more and wasn't one of those ""use your imagination"" endings."
__label__2 " Quick read: Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston."
__label__2 " True Bionic Serum: The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum"
__label__2 " great service: I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again."
__label__2 " Well worth the price!: This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital."
__label__2 " Exceptionally good analysis of consumer debt issues: The author helped launch the first credit card in the 1950's. He describes in detail the many bad things that have happened from Americans becoming too reliant on plastic, living beyond their means. Should be required reading for all high school students!!!!"
__label__2 " ladies citizen: My wife loves it. Got it for her as a gift. She says co-workers compliment her on it. I like the eco-drive technology from citizen, its cool that you dont have to ever worry about a battery. As for keeping time.. this is dead on, just like my Eco-drive."
__label__2 I Love this watch thanks amazon !: This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.
__label__1 " Buyer BEWARE: This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase"
__label__1 " There's gold in that there cave: A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents."
__label__2 " Unforgettable: ""I hope this book will never be read."" So begins Yourcenar's Fires...a richly dense collection of famous myths and legends stunningly revitalized through the voices and eyes of the heroines. Intertwining the stories are excerpts from Yournenar's own journal taken from the time during which she had written the stories. Achingly familiar to anyone recovering from a broken heart, Yourcenar marries the heartache of this century's woman to women throughout the ages."
__label__2 stories of the spirit: this is a beautiful book. the one i had for years got compromised by the mold damage we had in our old home so had to be thrown out. since this was one of my favourite books -- of course i had to get another one.
__label__2 " Excellent sound: The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it."
__label__2 " I own one and I want another!!!: I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Now they are out of stock and I can't find one. For the price, this product delivers fine sound. I agree with some previous reviewers on the issue of the battery, but that is a minor point. I love the sound!!! It also has good radio reception for stations that are at the fringe of the FM reception band. I did not buy it as a clock radio, but as a less expensive alternative to Bose. At $400 less than the comparable Bose, I say ""go for it'! I hope it is available soon."
__label__1 " Definitive of what?: A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work."
__label__1 " How could this happen.....: Jefferson Starship at the time(1983)had released 3 outstanding albums, Freedom at Point Zero, Modern Times, Wind of Change. If anyone had the opportunity to see the band with drummer Ansley Dunbar, You know how disappointing this video is. Unfortunately, when listening to songs like ""Stranger"" you could hear the bands new drummer(???)the mistakes and missed drum fills. It's a shame that the band never released any Video performance of the band with Dunbar. It's a good mix of song selection. Too bad they didnt fine tune the playing.(Why didnt they play ""Save Your Love"" ""Lightening Rose"" ""RockMusic"")"
__label__1 " This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha"
__label__1 A classic book sold by weight not content: Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example: p50. Q6. Which of the following acids are polyprotic? Acetic; Sulphuric; Hypochlorous; Nitric; all of the above. Answer: Carbonic! PLEASE! Chemistry is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse.
__label__1 " Most horrendous test prep book in press...: Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel."
__label__1 " This book is a Travesty: With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?"
__label__1 " Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks."
__label__1 " sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort."
__label__1 " Wish I could give zero stars: Avoid this book at all costs. It contains numerous errors, misleading items, and misspellings. In the example problems, many of the answers are worked out to find something other than what the original question asked (i.e. oxidation state instead of coordination number). I suggest the author, Monique Laberge, allow someone else to write the next edition."
__label__1 " nothing but errors in this book: I agree completely with the other reviews of this book. I just spent an hour deriving and re-deriving the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The previous review tells me what I need to know -- it is incorrect in this book!!! There are so many errors that it is actually more work to review material that I already know than it was to learn it the first time. It's a shame I can't give zero stars on this review."
__label__1 " I could have written a better book myself: The author's alleged PhD is quite polemical. I think it averaged an error per page or so. For the 15 minutes I glanced it over, I think I became dumber."
__label__1 " Monkies on typewriters: You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes."
__label__1 " Not so good: I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers."
__label__1 " This book is the worst you could use for your GRE prep: This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it."
__label__2 " New to collecting? This will help.: Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the ""Exploration and Travel"" chapter instead of the ""Tobbaco"" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."
__label__2 " Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference...: This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!"
__label__2 Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards. Information is given on the history of the cards as well as many examples. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in collecting or just want to know more about Victorian cards.
__label__2 " AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana"
__label__1 " sloppy: I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
__label__1 " Consider American Made Products: Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American."
__label__1 " Knock off: This is just a knock off of crocodile dentist. It comes from China, and was already broken. The package was so beat up, I couldn't even give it as a gift. Also, it doesn't work. It just snaps every 2nd tooth, and sometimes the teeth don't pop up. This is a very small version as well, the description doesn't tell you it's travel size."
__label__1 Item seemed like it was used not a new product!: Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
