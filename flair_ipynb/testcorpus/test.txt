__label__1 " Cheaply made: I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
__label__1 " do not waste your money: i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
__label__1 " Broken right out of the box: I wasn't expecting much, but was disappointed that this game didn't even survive shipping. It didn't work right out of the box. The mouth won't close as it should (which is the whole point of the game). I'm a speech therapist and thought this would be a cute game for my students, but it's going back as it's a piece of junk."
__label__1 Knock Off: I am upset to see that this is a knock off. How is it legal for them to sell this? I guess amazon does not care to protect it's buyers...
__label__1 " crap: This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
__label__2 " Great for young kids: I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
__label__2 Fun toy!: I got this for my 4 yr old for Christmas. I thought it would be bigger then it is so it ended up being a stocking stuffer but it is still super fun. It ended up being a good size because we can put it in a backpack to take on trips or to the doctors office to him occupied. The best part of the game is the anticipation on when it is going to snap closed adds to the excitement. The only down side is the head will snap off if it's opened too hard which happen with a 4 yr old sometimes but it's easy to put back on.
__label__1 " pinches fingers: My son got this last year for his fourth birthday. He only played it a few times when it slammed down and somehow pinched his fingers hard enough to make him cry. He never wanted to play the game again, I ended up getting rid of it. There are too many other fun and safe games out there to bother with this one."
__label__1 " horrible!: this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it."
__label__1 " very small and lasted about 1 hour: I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)"
__label__2 " Cheap, fun toy: This is a fun toy and better than I expected. It is not very durable and sometimes the teeth stick down, but overall it is enjoyable. My older daughter loves to play with me, but it is even easy enough for my 1yr old to play too. It's also small enough for the younger one to hold. Their surprise when the mouth snaps shut is adorable."
__label__2 " Cute but overpriced: I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."
__label__2 " I love this toy!: I am a Speech Therapist and this is a toy that the children with whom I work (3,4, and 5 year olds) ask for over and over again. They just love it! I have the small travel one which is perfect since I travel all around for my job. If the child is too afraid to push the teeth down I give him/her a tongue depressor or my pencil so the crocodile bites that instead of the child."
__label__1 " Not what I expected: When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game."
__label__1 " Not as durable as I thought it would be.: The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way."
__label__2 " quick reflexes!: I've used this game with kids of all ages, including children with special needs. It's a good idea to demo the game first to show them what happens (and the unpredictability). Kids that have issues getting their finger ""bitten"" can use a pencil or popsicle stick to press down the teeth. The end result is always lots of laughs. On the adult front, it could be a good drinking game :)"
__label__1 " Fun, but fragile: My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again."
__label__1 " Just OK: I guess it's my own fault for not really reading the description, but this thing is TINY. Was fun enough but the kids (3 & 4) figured out which tooth was the ""bad"" one after @ 30 seconds of playing with it. Not worth the money."
__label__2 " Cute!: Bought this for my 3 yr old boy, but my 6 yr old boy likes playin with it too. My younger boy is a little afraid of the mouth snapping shut but still likes to play with it. They did figure out that the tooth that causes the mouth to close is harder to push so its easy to cheat. So we made a rule that once you touch it, you gotta push it! :) I would recommend this toy, its fun."
__label__1 " broken in days: I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!"
__label__2 " Great for playdates, but a bit fragile: We are on our third crocodile dentist! It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE. But I carry it to the park in a large toy bag and the past two copies have broken...when you press a tooth it won't stay down anymore. A good way around this might be to keep it in a box of it's own.This is also a wonderful toy for parents following the RDI Steve Gutstein social therapy for children with Autism. Because this toy has an element of surprise, as you press each tooth you never know if this is the tooth that will cause the jaw to snap shut! Note: the snapping shut is fairly gentle and safe for preschoolers!"
__label__1 " Piece of junk: It broke, I swear, the second time my child touched the teeth. I have never seen a toy do that. Maybe I just got a lemon."
__label__1 " Travel Sized --- Not what I expected: So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
__label__1 Doesn't work! Cheaply made.: Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.
__label__1 " WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY: I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"
__label__2 " Fun for Tots and Preschoolers: We just got this for our 2 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 year old. They love it. The 2 year old is a little scared but he will play sometimes and he really likes to watch. The 4 year old loves it, especially if you make your reaction to the gater bites dramatic."
__label__1 " Doesn't work: I bought this game for my children at Christmas and it didn't work from the second we pulled it from the package. The teeth get stuck and the mouth doesn't close most of the time. I didn't return it because it would cost more to deal with than I paid for it. Maybe I just got a bad one, who knows. My kids still play with it (they are only 3) but not the way it was meant to be played with. I would recommend just going with the full sized one, not the travel size."
__label__2 " Great fun, no pieces: I am a dental hygientist and this toy is the hit with kids from 2 thru 15!! I give it 5 stars, somehow it found its way home with a patient and now I am so glad I found it again."
__label__2 " Cheap, Entertaining Toy for Preschoolers: I bought this when my twins were 3 1/2. It was a cheap item, there are no pieces to lose, and it's simple enough that the girls can play together. If they want you to play with them, the game is very quick. The top jaw has fallen off a few times but I think this was my girls' fault - too rough with it - and each time, I've snapped it back on."
__label__2 " Fun but short lived: I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!"
__label__1 Travel Toy: I was VERY disappointed with this toy. This is not a full size toy but rather a travel toy. I could not believe how small this was for the price I paid (around $13.00). I will be checking to see what the return policy is on this item. I would NOT recommend if you are looking for an actual game for more than one child to play.
__label__2 " Fragile: This toy broke within the first two minutes that I took it out of the box. My son is 4 years old and has had most of his toys for a long time and is not particulary destructive, so I was surprised after reading all the reviews for it- how great it was-- you could imagine my disapointment. I do not give this toy a favorble reccomendation."
__label__1 " Crocodile Doom: The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little."
__label__1 " May not appeal to toddler: My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
__label__1 Broken right out of the box: At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
__label__1 Cheap Plastic: This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
__label__1 " Instantly broke: We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
__label__1 " Very small, flimsy and not working properly: Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same."
__label__1 disappointed: We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
__label__1 " Not enough info: The description didn't say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Doesn't work that great, either."
__label__1 Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
__label__1 " Horrible Quality: This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking."
__label__1 " doesn't live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
__label__1 piece of junk: We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
__label__1 " This Toy is JUNK!!!: I bought this toy for my Grandson for Christmas, because he asked for it. I was looking for the original Crocodile Dentist game by Milton Bradley, but they are few and far between and expensive. So I got this this. When it arrived I was shocked by how small it was and how cheap it looked!! On Christmas day my Daughter called me and said the thing did NOT work. The teeth would go down, and never come back up!!! So it is as cheap as it looks. This thing is going back, and I would NOT recommend this to anybody!!!! IT IS JUNK!!!! Bring back the original Milton Bradley game!!!!"
__label__1 " Cute Concept, broke within 5 minutes: I purchased this toy for my 3 year old nephew, who absolutely loves crocodiles. I personally opened it and played with him. Half of the teeth went down and never came back up. The head never even snapped down. I wouldn't recommend this toy, as cute as it looks."
__label__1 " fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing."
__label__1 " cute idea, but not worth it, save your money: Cute idea, but toy is cheaply made and doesn't work most of the time. Not worth it, save your money."
__label__2 " Silly Stupid Fun!: We bought this as a clearance item for a lot cheaper than what it's selling for on Amazon. This toy has been dropped, sat on, stepped on, etc. In other words, it survived a toddler and a little boy. It's so stupid it's fun. We've had a great time with it."
__label__1 " Not what I was hoping for...: This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid."
__label__1 " Boring...: the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust."
__label__2 *: Played game with 4 year old students- they loved it. It kept them guessing and were surprised every time.
__label__2 " Exciting Kid Toy: I could sense the heart pumping excitement builds up every time my 4 year old play this game. He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic. This is a great toy in a dentist's waiting area."
__label__1 " Scary: I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years"
__label__1 " Disappointed: I was disappointed in this toy. It was a travel size and I was expecting a bigger size. I had seen the larger version and was really looking forward to giving it to my daughter. As is turns out, she was a little scared of it anyway, so she probably would have really been scared of the larger one. Anyway, it is a great toy, but I would prefer the larger version."
__label__1 " Disapointed: WARNING! THIS IS NOT THE CROCODILE DENTIST GAME THAT YOU GREW UP WITH! I had the idea to buy Crocodile Dentist for a Christmas present for a five year old boy. I remember playing the game when I was younger and I loved it! (the original toy has teeth that you pull out of the croc's mouth and the crocodile was atleast 3 times larger then this pewny little thing). Not only did they change how you play the game, but the size as well...what a jip...shame on them!"
__label__1 " Horrible: My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas."
__label__1 " Crocodile Dentist: It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale."
__label__2 cute toy: Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
__label__1 " This was the worst toy I have ever purchased: This was awful. I guess you get what you pay for!!!!! When we opened for the grand daughters to pay with Christmas Eve, the teeth was sticking and there was no excitement. I was suppose to snap it did nothing."
__label__1 " Disappointed: My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (books about going to the dentist, the books Open Wide and Dr. DeSoto, ...) so we were really hoping this toy would get his attention too. However, it is just not very entertaining and it is also very fragile. The teeth would get stuck from the first day we opened it and after dropping it a couple of times, it broke apart, so we are no longer able to use it anyway.Unfortunately, this toy was a dud at our home."
__label__2 " Best game of all time: If you are looking for something fun for any age, look no further. You simply must play it, you will be as addicted as we are."
__label__1 Purchased twice-never worked: My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
__label__1 " awful: I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
__label__1 " Broke after a week: A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
__label__1 " unhappy: don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
__label__2 crowd pleaser: This is a small game - easy to pack and take anywhere. It is a lot of fun for kids all ages. My 5 year old recieved it at Christmas but it was played all day by kids younger and older. It gets a laugh every time. The jaw came undone once - but was easy to put back together. It's nice to see the kids enjoy such a simple game among all the techie toys they recieved.
__label__1 " Don't waste your money: This is a knock off of the real toy. It came in a weird box and the toy was rattling around, not even tied down. It already looked played with. The box had several odd phrases on it like the toy is ""elegant"". What??!! Obviously a foreign knock off - and a cheap one at that!"
__label__1 " NOT the Crocodile Dentist you think you're getting. China replica.: I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
__label__1 " broken when I opened the box: When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
__label__2 Best Chocolate bar ever: This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
__label__2 " Cheap and works really well!: Bought a pair of these after reading about a little DIY someone did with the SonySony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and adding a crossover to them. Was an incredibly straight forward install and so far I'm really pleased with the noticeably richer sound I'm getting. I'm a college student on a budget which is why I went with the Sony's in the first place but these cross overs definitely stayed in budget and were worth the purchase.I was contemplating making my own cross over but gave in to the simplicity.Also wanted to note that these shipped very quickly, arrived 3 days after ordering and they made a very far journey."
__label__1 " Beautiful music, lousy packaging: I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing."
__label__2 " He Had a Great Voice: Matt Monro had a great voice. It's a shame that he never reached greater status in the United States for having such a gift. There are 36 songs on this album and they are all good. His ""From Russia With Love"" vocal from the James Bond film is a classic."
__label__2 The Mennonite Hymnal: I collect old hymnals and lived in Mennonite country for a few years. 606 is the Mennonite Doxology. It's an awesome arrangement that is sung so beautifully a capella by the Mennonites. So glad to have my own copy of this!
__label__1 " Tedious Reds under the beds stuff: Mr Drury's earlier novels are well received (Advise and Consent, particularly). I won't be bothering to read any more after this rather tedious 'The Russian's are coming to get us' effort. We all know now how that turned out. I will say that is slightly more believable than 'Red Dawn', slightly."
__label__2 its nice: I was replacing my old cook book & I thought this was the same one but it isn't but it is a nice cook book.
__label__2 " Best show you've never seen: This is the last good show that MTV ever made. Unfortunately, they only lasted one season; by the time it aired, MTV's audience had become too stupid to keep this show afloat. Suffice to say that the show is excellent, and nonstop laughs. It is very clever, and I have purchased a copy for myself, and continue to purchase more, to give out as gifts for xmas and birthdays."
__label__2 " So Sad...: How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show? Leave it to Mtv to can something as great as this in favor of dreck like ""My Super Sweet Sixteen."" They should be ashamed of themselves (well, they should've been ashamed of themselves long before this, but that's besides the point).Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Ghandi & JFK (along with a host of others)... cloned... in high school...Very well-written... great voice casting (Will Forte, Nicole Sullivan, Michael McDonald)... a great show that didn't get a chance, thanks to a once great network that has gone down the pooper."
__label__2 " Hilarious!: So many clever references in this show. I love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist. It's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about JFK sleeping with ""Catherine-the-Not-So-Great"" that I get the giggles and end up watching another episode when I thought I could just watch one."
__label__2 Greatest animated show ever: This is the best animated series ever. I found it originally on Youtube and fell in love with it. I'm so pissed that it's cancelled. The show is a comedy blendin slapstick and paroding teen dramas. the cast itself is enough to make you laugh. the DVD is in great condition by it and maybe just maybe the show will come back.
__label__2 " Amazing: Loved this show eight years ago, still loving it now. It is very tongue in cheek, literally and figuratively. I can't decide if my favorite episode is ""Litter Kills"" or ""Makeover, Makeover, Makeover: The Makeover Episode."" They're both so awesome. Buy it, watch it, love it. It's amazing."
__label__2 " I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found...: This book saved my grade in Constitutional Law. A week before the final I was so confused and lost in the material and I was freaking out! I bought this book as a last hope at saving my grade, and not only did it save my grade, I got one of the best grades in the class!! This is the BEST supplement I have seen yet that explains and ties everything together. I would recommend it a thousand times over to all law students who need a little (or a lot) of help with Constitutional Law."
__label__1 " Ultra-bad sound quality: This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"
__label__2 " Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that..."
__label__2 " Classic Bowie and Ronson: This is one cool but dated video. It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson, deceased, available. It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era. It's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear. It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder."
__label__2 " glam rock at it's best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog."
__label__1 " I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible. It must have been wonderful to be at Hammersmith Odeon when this concert was performed, but it sure didn't translate well onto film. Listen to the recordings and skip this disaster."
__label__2 " Stardust Memories: If you like all that pre-grunge grunge dressed up in outlandish costumes and enough make-up to cause Angela Bowie blush, you'll David and the Spiders ripping their way through their hits and a couple of covers including Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"" and Lou Reed's ""White Light, White Heat.""Grungy and gaudy before either were cool!"
__label__1 " Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
__label__1 " Where in the world is the original mix?: I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."
__label__2 " A nice DVD: I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie."
__label__1 " disappointing: One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. But, after making all the adjustments I could think of I could not make the sound (or video for that matter) quality acceptable. As much as I adore David Bowie, I haven't even been able to watch this even once all the way through. I did notice that the favorable reviews were for the VHS version of this film. Too bad, such potential!"
__label__1 " Agree with Maltin: I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. Pennebaker obviously had a very low budget, and probably the film sat around for years before he pieced it together in a lame moment. I enjoyed seeing the different costume changes most..."
__label__1 " You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd...: As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
__label__1 " Ziggy stardust & the DVD from the rubbish bin: I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it""s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it."
__label__2 " Camera work not 100% but great music all the same.: I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful. But you have to consider how difficult it is to film at a live concert in the dark. At some points, the camera does shake and it becomes hard to see Ziggy. However, the music ROCKS! And it is definitely worth buying! I watch it ALL THE TIME!"
__label__2 " The Best Book In The World!!: I have read over 100 books, but none as fabulous as this one. I know, I know, it's just a pony pals book! But this book had real meaning. I don't know why Angela or whoever is complaining about nothing bad ever happing to them, because that was exactly what happened in this book. The Pony Pals go away to a riding clinic. No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!! This book was very touching and helped me realize that ponies are just as good as horses, if not better."
__label__2 " My nephews love them!: I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don't fight with one another. My only complain is the flashlight, very poor quality. The light keeps going off and on, even with a new battery. I think it's a connection problem. Aside from that... my nephews love them."
__label__2 " More plastic toys, but they'll have fun...: My 4 yr old is really into hunting so this is perfect for him right now. Yeah, it's more plastic that will eventually break and the binoculars arent anything great but he doesnt know that. I think it will get lots of use especially from his own imagination. Cant beat that!"
__label__1 " pretty but delicate: this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
__label__2 " Mystical truth accessible to everyone!: What an awesome book! Author Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism. It was amazing to read the ways so many different people can come to experience the divine.What sets this apart from so many spiritual books is it brings divinity down to earth wihtout losing the divinity!And finally, a spiritual writer who finds a way to be honest and real, herself. Not an ounce of pretension!!!"
__label__2 " Great dada from the Bonzos!: Having heard most of the Bonzos' catalog (or catalogue, if you're in the UK), off of assorted collections and the Cornology boxed set, I leaped at the chance to own the original CD's (and this was the last one I purchased), because of the bonus tracks. As always, Neil Innes provides sharp and witty banter recounting the history of how the Bonzo tracks came into existence, and the music never fails to delight, especially 'The Craig Torso Show' where I would have nearly fell about laughing if I wouldn't have been in the car ('Craig Torso smells wonderfuuuuuuul'). Minus one star for again mis-labelling Sidney Nicholls (aka Big Sid, the guy playing banjo in the numbered group shot) as Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell."
__label__1 " Beware: I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. It does not say this clearly in the product description"
__label__2 " An Excellent Gift: I was given this book as a Christmas gift by a very good friend. She is American, I'm a Scot and, at first, I wondered why she was sending me a book called Inheriting Scotland. Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance."
__label__1 Not as expected: Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one.
__label__1 Color is not expresso!: We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
__label__2 " Beautiful music: Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. If I had not seen the movie, I would never have heard his compositions. This album would be loved by anyone who is moved by Celtic music. Beautiful!"
__label__2 " The Shipping News: I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound."
__label__2 " love this movie!: This is a great movie with an excellent cast and a beautiful score. I watch it over and over! Some of the scenes are a little bit gruesome, but they are somewhat necessary for the story."
__label__2 " Great performance!: This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD. I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc. I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect."
__label__1 " Adds very little to the online docu: This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: ""In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)."" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."
__label__1 " Falls far short of expectations.: The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent."
__label__1 Save your money.: Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation.
__label__1 " This book could have been something special...: It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
__label__1 " Good only for the beginners.: This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself."
__label__2 Scott: While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.
__label__1 " forget it for linux: The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground."
__label__1 Stick with the on-line docs: Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken
__label__1 " All this information is online.: This was the only Tomcat book available at the time I was looking, so I decided to pick it up to enhance my knowledge. However, almost all the information I found in it was available, sometimes verbatim, online."
__label__1 " this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects"": If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
__label__2 " Best book on the subject: (...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource."
__label__1 " Not nearly enough detail: It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat."
__label__2 Great Text.: Finally a text that goes beyond the high school like documentation packaged with Tomcat. I found everything I needed. I especially found value in the Chapters on deploying other Jakarta technologies into the Tomcat container.Great text.
__label__1 " Good lord! one of the WORST books out there!: I've read a quite a few technical books and by far, this one tops the list as being THE worst book I've ever read. Too much information missing, makes many assumptions that you know what you're doing. (If I knew what I was doing with Tomcat, why would I need the book?) Unbelievable. HORRIBLE is a word that comes to mind (among many others that would be ""bleeped"" off of here.)"
__label__1 " Worthless: I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
__label__1 " Incomplete and not thourough: This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today."
__label__2 " Great Book, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration: I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James."
__label__1 too expensive: The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
__label__2 " Great product, worth the nasty taste: It took me a while to get used to the flavor: very bitter. I put it in a little bit of water then wash it down with a whole lot of water, every evening. I notice a huge difference in my sleep, among other things. I highly recommend it!"
__label__1 " Cinematic satire is dead: Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."
__label__1 " Yes, this is a lame=weird movie: 1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting."
__label__1 " God, This Movie's A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie."
__label__1 " ridiculously overrated campy trash: Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap."
__label__1 " YYYYAAAAWWWWNNNN: What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I read. I guess I should have read more of them, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie a total bore.I was hoping it would get better, maybe a surprise scene in the middle or the end of the movie but it never happened!That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back."
__label__1 " Bad, bad, boring, bad: I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie."
__label__1 " Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust."
__label__1 " Waste of Money: It was a waste of money. In my opinion, it was just shy of being labeled a porno film."
__label__2 GET THE DVD BY ALL MEANS: The DVD has one of the best director's and actor's comments I have ever seen on a DVD.McLellan's performance is beyond positive description (did I spell his name right?).
__label__2 " Stunning and brilliant: I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""
__label__2 " Tender, wonderful movie: I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. Ian McKellan is just wonderful. The scene where he talks about the loss of his friend in WWI is so moving. The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again."
__label__2 " An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
__label__2 " Ian McKellen shines hauntingly.....: What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !"
__label__2 " Ian MacKellan was robbed at the Oscars!: He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded movie director James Whale (directed ""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and the 1936 ""Showboat"", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Instead of being turned off by his penchant for young boys, you felt sorry for him. Sir Ian was more worthy of the Best Actor Oscar than Benigni. Also excellent work by Lynne Redgrave and even Brendan Fraser. I would recommend this video to anyone!"
__label__2 " Good Movie: Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies. Knew little about ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale, but movie gives much insight."
__label__2 " Hollywood Queens and then some: A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?"
__label__1 " Why?: I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."
__label__1 " Boring,,,: Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man..."
__label__1 " A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.: First, forget anything about ""Frankenstein."" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled ""God, This Movie's A Monster!""For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."
__label__2 " Tender, Beautiful, and crack-me-up funny!!: This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
__label__2 " Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!: This movie has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!"
__label__1 " I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....: This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blas� film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying ""who cares?"" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."
__label__2 " A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called ""Father of Frankenstein,"" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you."
__label__2 " More than perfect: This movie is a masterpiece. IMHO, it is flawless in every aspect. Words cannot describe how wonderful these actors are. Ian McKellen has definitely dominated the show. He is like a beautiful centerpiece that is made of diamond. I couldn't move my eyes away from him. And Brendan Fraser is equally good; his strength is not a bit weaker than his counterpart. That is admirable. Finally, Lynn Redgrave, she has shone through the whole movie. She's perfect. The story telling is magically, the director, the screenwriter, the musician; the whole production team has done an incredible work to bring this tragedy story to live. These people are brilliant; they know their stuff; they know life; there is no doubt about that. What amazes me is that they also have a loving heart and that makes this movie extra special."
__label__2 " A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent: This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray."
__label__2 " good: I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a ""strong type "" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!"
__label__2 " Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character. She plays it pretty drab inside and out."
__label__1 " Boring, boring, boring!: Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along."
__label__2 " Brad Renfro films are always good.: I missed this title when it was in theaters. I have learned to appreciate Brad Renfro. Too bad, like Charlie Sheen, he was hooked on drugs but at a younger age."
__label__1 " No details = NO sale!: First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash...."
__label__1 " POOR SUPPORT: I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support"
__label__1 Not Thrilled: I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. After you hit the ball there is a streak that follows the ball. I found this annoying. I ended up taking it off my computer and found a different game that I like MUCH better. I'm glad I didn't pay a whole lot for this. It was disappointing.
__label__2 " Perfect For Rainy Day Golfing: As a person who frequents the golf course on a weekly basis, I can confidently say that this game may give real golf a run for its money. This game is a wonderful simulation of real life golf. The graphics and control settings are by far more realistic than any other simulated golf game out there. Unlike many other virtual golf game, Prostroke provides players with the ability to simulate the skills needed when playing a real golf game. I found myself angling my body as well as the club. I was even perfecting my footwork for the perfect shot. The game was great. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't always have time to run down to the golf course or just simply feels like hitting a few rounds from the comfort of their own home."
__label__1 don't buy it: it has some nice features and it's too bad that you can't see them. everything is black. the grass is black. the bunkers are black. I can't see anything.
__label__1 " don't bother: As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket."
__label__1 Disappointed: I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
__label__1 I did not receive the item: I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
__label__1 " quite bad: I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."

__label__1 " HORRIBLE: I would acttualy give it 0 stars. This book accuses the ming and Qing Emperors as horrible rulers and doesnt mention much about the manchus. it also criticies to much about the Qing Dynasty. Also, the information is OUTDATED/ along woith many words. DO NOT BUY THIS BOKK! DONNT EVEN LOOK AT IT!"
__label__2 Realistic Tree: This Xmas tree is a very lifelike and realistic tree and is just what we wanted for our living room! The lights on it are beautiful and the pine cones are a great added effect. Can't wait to put the presents underneath!
__label__2 " Christmas Tree, artificial: The GKI/ Bethlehem Ligh Glacier Christmas Tree is the first artificial tree that looks real and fools most of my guests. We saw the same tree at a well known hardware store for double the price. The tree is easy to assemble and even comes with a DVD that explains how to put tree together. The tree comes adorned with pinecones and snow frosted tips. It looks just like the trees we cut near Placerville, CA. It is our first artificial tree and we love it!"
__label__2 " Great item but very tight fit: This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won't move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal."
__label__1 " Trading one bad habit for another: Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!"
__label__2 " This is actually better than the Live From New Haven DVD! 13 extra minutes.: I have the Live From New Haven DVD and wasn't very impressed with the audio and picture quality. This VHS has a better picture quality and it sounded better. Not only that but it had back stage footage AND Pat Benatar performing ""Little Paradise"" as the last encore which wasn't shown on the Live From New Haven DVD/ or that 1998 VHS release. Also included was the video Love Is A Battlefield as it was a quick promo for the upcoming LP Live From Earth. I cannot find anywhere where she sings Little Paradise Live so I feel like the lucky few now!"

__label__2 " Babe: Enough said.: One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is clich�, that's what this is."
__label__2 " Excellent Biography: An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. ""Babe"" gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get."
__label__2 " Still The Best: Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first ""serious"" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."
__label__2 " Babe: The Legend Comes To Life: As author of the yet to be published ""Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,"" I have read every book I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth. The more I read, the more I appreciate Creamer's exhaustive account of Ruth's playing career. This one is, by far, the best of all and I keep it with me at all times when I am in need of reference material. It is the most thorough and comprehensive. It is easy to see why this book has endured the test of time - an amazing 33 years in print. Thank you, Robert Creamer, for your truly wonderful contribution, and may you enjoy many more years in print! Sincerely, Rebecca Rau"
__label__2 " Babe Ruth learned: As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike"
__label__2 " Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing."
__label__2 " Good Foundation: I found this book to be packed with great information and recommend it to be added to any PHA library. It not only gives good basic knowledge, but also includes study and research paths which lead into further light and understanding of our craft in modern aspects.""Black Square and Compass"" also shows the correlation and significance of PHA in association with modern black history. For example accomplishments of the Buffalo Soldiers and the network of the Underground Railroad."
__label__2 " Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time."
__label__2 " worked perfectly!: After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly."
__label__1 " Not the best I have: I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. I have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. The stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if I don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. Compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. I regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when I got my small one."
__label__1 " very poor quality: This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires."
__label__2 " Great Price, Great Product: Love these and easy to use. You really can not put it though twice though if you mess up. I have only used it on a laser printer because that's what it says it's for. Awesome price so I don't wince too much when I mess up. I'll only buy these from now on."
__label__2 " Office Max wants $40 for this: It works on my laser printer. Only after receiving the product did I realize there is another type of film made by the same company, specifically for laser printers. This is technically for copiers (same premise, I know)."
__label__1 " for laser printers only: This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund."
__label__2 " Great little known tips: I am an avid gardener who has accumulated many books on the subject. I thought to myself, why do I need one more? I originally took this book out from my local library and enjoyed it so much I wanted to buy it to have it for permanent reference. It covers everything from soil (how and when to test), to all types of plants (flowers, herbs, shrubs,etc). The illustrations are many and help visually guide the reader with steps for things like pruning, staking, composting, etc. The tips are simple and are environmentally friendly. Two things that are important to me. I'd highly recommend this book whether you have one book on gardening or 100."
__label__2 Good service: I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
__label__2 " Great photographs.: Ok I'm a little biased on this book, since there is a hundred year old picture of my house in it. But I really loved the old pictures. The whole series of city history books published by this company are very interesting, specially if you live or own a home in the cities."
__label__2 Fantastic show: My husband and I have come to love this show. It is very appropriate for children too. It is so funny and the story line is really well put together. I highly highly recommend.
__label__2 " The Review: Kenichi is definitely worth buying. It's full of humor and action, and who doesn't think that a guying being shown up by a female martial artist is funny."
__label__1 Blah......: What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
__label__1 " Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total: I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."
__label__1 " This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all. The characters are shallow and the situation is contrived. Reading the entire book was painful, and I would not have continued reading it if it wasn't a book club selection. Save your money and your time. Don't bother reading this book!"
__label__2 " We aren't in Kansas anymore: I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
__label__1 " Surrender this one: After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library."
__label__2 " Absorbing and Felt Real: This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought ""women's literature"" books for my book club!"
__label__1 " Boring,Boring,Boring,,,: How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
__label__2 " funny and heartbreaking: I loved this book -- it's among Wolitzer's best. The writing is sharp, funny and epigrammatic, the characters rich, the plot full of twists and turns. I can't wait for the movie!"
__label__1 " Would not buy were I you: The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing. I did not like at all. Was there even an editor? If you desperately want to give it a try, borrow somewhere (not that you'll find it in the library).... just don't buy it!"
__label__1 Disappointed: I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
__label__1 " Left me cold: Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on."
__label__2 " Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!: Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human."
__label__2 " Big Chill in Little London: A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."
__label__1 " A little disappointed...: Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-("
__label__2 " For those who like word of mouth cult movies...: and especially British underground cult movies, check out ""Final Cut"" - and then ""Love, Honour & Obey"" (the sequel, written by the same two guys, and featuring the same set of actors). The first time I saw ""Final Cut"" back in 98 I was gripped by the edgy, rawness of this ""reality movie"" format, and the shear thought-provoking nature of the film. (I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the ""Primrose Hill"" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!)."
__label__1 " Trash Pure and Simple: This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy. A complete piece of rubbish."
__label__2 " For professionals only: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques."
__label__1 " Not as well-made as I'd hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it."
__label__1 " Not up to expectations.: I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!) He warns that not all ""outlets"" really offer great bargains -- but you have to check 'em all out yourself to find out which ones do.And guess what -- he says you can get great prices at Sams, KB Toys, and Tuesday Morning. Well, ""duh""."
__label__2 Everything I ever wanted to know: This dictionary is the best medical dictionary I've come across. It's full of illustrations and makes searching for things easy.
__label__2 " Mosbys medical dictionary: Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures."
__label__2 " mosby's dictionary: it's been very helpful, i'm taking medical coding and there are things i did not know so i looked it up and was very helpful. i will continue using it."
__label__2 " Better Lucky than Smart: I ordered Tabers Cyclopedic guide first, but it arrived with some pages damaged in binding. And it seemed compressed in size and with its explanations. So I sent it back (thank you damage) and switched to Mosby's. Hooray! Bigger & better & more thorough with LOTS of pictures. The words searched for are printed in blue, with the definitions in black, making it easy to scan for your subject. Lucky me."
__label__2 This dictionary makes looking up words fun.: I bought Mosby's because it's easy to read and look up medical terms. I'm learning the language and this book is formatted for easy readability. The numerous illustrations are all in color which I found informative. It's definitely a user-friendly dictionary.
__label__2 Mosby's Medical Dictionary: I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.
__label__2 " Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary was bought for my wife studying to become a LicensedMassage Therapist. In the course of her Physiology studies it becameapparent that for the terminology being used required a stronger, moreprecise definition to her study even more than her Physiology book.Thismet her need and has been a tool that will become part of her workinglibrary.Jack Watson"
__label__2 Mosby's Medical Dictionary 7th Ed: I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
__label__2 " Cap in Terrell, Tx.: I really do like using Mosby's Medical Dictionary because it is an easy print to read. I am currently taking an Internet course in Medical Terminology. When I don't understand a word I quickly look it up in Mosby's Medical Dictionary for more clarification. The graphic pictures are excellent. In addition, I will be purchasing Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary."
__label__1 " Much Is Missing: This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. All it came with was the Atlas of Anatomy and the word definitions. So very upset with this purchase."
__label__2 Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary is a great resource. It is full of wonderful color pictures and are very interesting. This book has helped me in many of my classes this semester.
__label__2 Easy to understand: I bought this book to compliment my Taber's Medical Dictionary. I'm glad that I did. I found that some of the diseases in Taber's were vague and when I looked them up in Mosby's I found easy to understand definitions with lots of pictures of diseases.
__label__1 " I finally found it: My search is over. I have finally found the absolute worst record in the history of recorded sound. These guys are so awful they make the Dead sound like the Vienna Boys Choir. The stuff on this record cannot even be called music. They must have been great at PR, because they had absolutely no ability to make recorded sound at all. I heard that one of them is dead. Good. One down, one to go."
__label__1 " One of the most disappointing Heinlein books: This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the ""gee shucks, we're in the space patrol"" line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."
__label__2 " A child's adventure story; an adult's classic: It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real."
__label__2 " One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories: This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility"
__label__2 " A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18: JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad."
__label__1 " OOPS!: I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged... Let's just say I strongly recommend you do not use this inside. Your insurance WILL NOT cover any related incident!Oh, the humanity!"
__label__2 " DOUBLE MEASURE!: Putting things in perspective is only part of what Eduardo learns as he attempts to ""measure up"" to the RULERS. A super little bilingual story on learning how to prioritize our duties."
__label__1 Mediocrity for our times: The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
__label__1 " Command and Control at the Top: Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles."
__label__1 " Misses the Point: I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as ""amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,"" ""disrupt the natural order of things,"" ""seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,"" ""seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,"" ""time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,"" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
__label__2 " Good Godowsky.: These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts. Recording sound also leaves something to be desired."
__label__1 " Horrible: I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back."
__label__1 " Almost awful product from Borner!: I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. The grater is almost dull, made of very thin metal that bended while sitting in the drawer. The metal blade also fell once, but I managed to insert it back. The handle is uncomfortable due to it sharp shapes. I gave the stars for the other uses, as I successfully managed to open an orange with it. It might also work for other tasks, but not for grating.I can't believe Borner was able to produce such a bad tool. I am not recommending it, as there are many other better graters on the market!"
__label__2 " Borner Veggie Peeler: I used to have this peeler, but it was misplaced during moving. I used it for good 4 years and it never dulled, rusted, or got out of shape. Perfect quality and materials. I am glad I found it! Thank you, Amazon!"
__label__1 " Not Vermont American: You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand ""Do It Best"" crap FROM CHINA. Junk don't buy."
__label__2 " Afterthoughts ... Music for the soul and spirit: In this busy, crazy, and sometimes angry world of ours, it is a gift to relax and listen to Kristi's arrangements of both original and classic music. I found the album a tool for helping me to relax at the end of a hard day, or to listen too simply for the soothing harmonies and flowing tonal art. Add this CD to your collection of ""Music for your Soul and Spirit."""
__label__2 " VERY HARD TO FIND 1982 RELEASES! BUT VERY GOOD ONES!: I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin' this 1982 release every day. ""My Favorite Person"" had all the classic flavor of the O'Jays. Itwas probably their last classic Philly sound release as the problems Philadelphia International would have with CBS Records wouls eventually set in and a move to EMI would be forthcoming. ""Your Body's Here With Me"" is the signature cut on this reissued double album but ""My Favorite Person"", ""I Just Want To Satisfy"", and ""One On One"" were classic cuts as well. ""When Will I See You Again"" dropped great songs with their own version of the classic Three Degrees hit. Check out ""I Can't Stand The Pain"". These two albums are probably the hardest to find of all of the O'Jays albums besides the ones released on the TSOP(The Sound Of Philadelphia) label. PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE ITS NOW ON 1 CD!"
__label__2 Good Bed: Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.
__label__1 " Tore within a few days. Heavy bed with 2 cedar bags inside.: This was the worst dog bed I ever purchased. Within the first few days, the fabric tore along the side seam and every time I wanted to move it, the cedar bags fell out of the giant rip. I can't imagine why this wasn't constructed with thicker fabric and industrial stitching. The bed is heavy and awkward to move. Inside are 2 cedar bags and 1 foam pad, so that when you move it, those cedar bags will overlap each other, then the bed has a big lump in it. You have to get those cedar bags side-by-side in there. What a pain! I purchased the large bed, so possibly this is why there were 2 bags. Also, you can only wash the thin outer bag that holds the cedar bags and foam pad inside."
__label__1 " Too noisy!: The combination of the cedar and the nylon made this bed incredibly noisy. I had to pick my dog and put her on it, and once she got off of it, she wouldn't go back on. She looked at me like she was being tortured being on it. She did sleep on it for one night but wouldn't go back on it at all. Not exactly the dog bed I had in mind."
__label__1 " Great group, poor dvd: Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video."
__label__1 crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007: DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
__label__1 " Santana - Live by Request: War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
__label__1 Nothing New!! Same as SuperNatural but......: Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
__label__2 " Still Amazing: Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content."
__label__2 " Nutritious and delicious: Though one reviewer felt the format of this book was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for ""cooked rice"" or ""cooked peas"". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth."
__label__2 Recipes for a Small Planet: Great book for vegetarian recipes. Great for a new vegetarian oranyone who enjoys meatless recipes.
__label__1 " Nearly Useless: I've owned this cookbook for years. A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy."
__label__2 " Bought it again for our second child!: These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. They have pockets for the photos rather than those electrostatic pages which makes them far easier to use (in my opinion). They also have space to write notes next to each photo. We liked the one we got for our daughter so much, we bought another when we had our son."
__label__2 Good: This is an excellent item. The seller shipped fast and I am 100% satisfied with the overall transaction. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
__label__2 " They didn't live happily every after: Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna."
__label__1 " Not good: If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing."
__label__2 " beautiful dancing: I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to Aradia after seeing how professional she always looks in her magazine photos, but having read all the other reviews, I took a chance and bought this dvd. I can only add to the praise by saying, Aradia took her time and thoughtfully planned all the components of this dvd. Might not be suitable for a beginner, but if you are a beginner, get this dvd anyway so you have it when you are ready for it."
__label__2 " So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it."
__label__1 " Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!"
__label__1 " Not true to description!: Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section."
__label__2 " Excelente: Manu es una de los mejores cantantes del Operacion Triunfo.Aunque la musica es un poco 'easy listening', este CD es su premera y Manu la hace muy bien y no se falta su voz. Me encanta este chico y creo que el va a hacer mucho mas."
__label__2 " Touching, sad, but moving and worth the read: Although many people think that reading such books as these, the accounts of teenagers who died while under the Nazi regime, is depressing...people should tell them, it should be. This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you."
__label__1 I don't like it: IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. no action at all. I had to read it for a school project on the holocaust and I ended up changing my book. I personally thought it wasn't good.
__label__1 " We Are Witnesses: When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book."
__label__2 " This is a good book: I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."
__label__1 " Ok I guess: This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective."
__label__2 " Book=Very GOOD!: I thought this book was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager's lives and the victims of the Holocaust. It was sad to know how well-off Americans in the U.S. and other fortunate people had it then. When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others. But I would have liked it more if he would have described more about what the Nazis would do to the victims after they were transported. Otherwhise, I liked this book very much."
__label__2 " Outstanding CD: I have all 4 cd's - now waiting for the new cd, November 24 ... ""All of the Above"" thank you Brian Maes for some of the best music to come around in years."
__label__2 " Caught the fever!: I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
__label__1 Sent wrong book: I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
__label__1 " A flimsy and heavily biased account of problems in America: Thomas Sullivan attempts to cover a broad array of social problems confronting American society. He addresses race, drugs, crime, social inequality, gender, and many other relevant issues. I found his assessment of these issues superficial often misapplying or incorrectly citing material referenced. His ideology is readily apparent, and throughout most of the book influences his discussion of the issues. Instead of taking an objective and critical look at our social problems, he embarked on a one-sided journey of his personal opinion. Unfortunately, I was required to use this book in a course on Social Issues. I am hopeful that anyone considering this book in the future will see this review and avoid it at all costs."
__label__1 One of the great medieval Jewish poets and thinkers: Solomon ibn Gabriol 1021-1058 is one of the great Jewish medieval poets and thinkers. He lived a difficult life of wandering . His poetry is filled with a strong sense of the majesty of God. And his works are part of the Jewish liturgy.
__label__1 Crack: I gave it to a friend. He put it in the freezer to use that evening and when he pulled it out it was cracked. :( Disappointing.
__label__1 " all cracked up: Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn't know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can't get full refund...sad :("
__label__2 AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE: I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
__label__1 " Good beginning, bad ending: This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."
__label__2 " A plain and simple NASB...: This Bible is the new updated NASB translation. The translation is accurate, but this particular Bible has only the basics. The print is fairly cramped, and as far as extra perks go, there are a few B&W maps and a small concordance. A good economy Bible to own, but no special frills."
__label__1 " Poor quality.: I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore. They have the imitation leather cover. All of the covers have come unbound from the pages. Very poor quality. I love the NASB, but this is just poorly made."
__label__2 " NASB: Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand."
__label__2 " Fun, suspenseful movie: This DVD is in fine condition and the movie is well done as well as exciting and fun to watch. My husband and I both enjoyed it despite our different tastes when it comes to movies."
__label__1 Why so much?: I've heard of this movie and was interested in picking it up. But can one of youmovie nerds explain why the price for this is so high?
__label__2 " Was he?: The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
__label__2 " A Dead Hero!: This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans. It was a clever plot to plant a body with rank, papers, and identification in a location that was backed by information of tides, sea currents, etc. There was the usual anxious feelings of being discovered especially when the Germans decided to send a spy to England to verify whether this person really existed. The plot becomes more tense when he confronts the woman whose picture was found on the body along with a love letter!"
__label__2 " The Man Who Never Was: Although later historical facts have put a few holes in the details of this CD and the original book, the content was in the main true to the actual happenings. Clifton Webb's acting job was top notch. A good spy stroy based on actual events."
__label__2 A Classic British WWII Film: This film showes the Brits as the Masters of faking out the Crowns Enemies. It also shows that not all the most effective fighting involves fix bayonets and charge.
__label__1 " I'm glad the man never was, I wish the movie never was either!: Adopting the story of operation ""Mincemeat"" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined."
__label__1 " Dull as Lead: Thirty minutes into the film, viewing it in w/s, I ejected the disc. I thought the characters were two-dimensional. I thought the script was hackneyed. I thought the direction was plodding. ""Dam Busters"" held my interest. ""The Man Who Never Was"" did not."
__label__2 " Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story: If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time."
__label__2 " The Man Who Never Was: This one of the iconic British movies from the 1950's. The story line and the cast were just magnificent. I have watched this movie many times over the years, mainly on late night television. I was surprised that the movie is still available. The story is based on true events from thne 2nd WW and this forgotten hero in one effort did a lot to help shorten the War. His father should be given more recognition for the act of selfless love in donating his Sons body to the war effort."
__label__2 " A good quality WWII movie bases on a true story: To think that British Intelligence created this allusion to fool the Nazis during World War II is just magnificent. A ripping good yarn. Well done Amazon.com. This DVD is not released in AUSTRALIA. Making the purchase on line was simple, quick and easy. Regards Mr. T J SOMERVILLE, GAWLER EAST, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA"
__label__2 " Cheers for The Man Who Never Was: I had always tought of clifton Webb as that weird guy who starred only in The Stars And Stripes For Ever, A 1950's verson of The Titanic and Cheaper By The Dozen. He comes a accross as a brilliant ex attorney, an Hercules Poirot type almost, trying to think one step ahead of the Gerries in this wonderful espionage thriller.True there are no big battle scenes but how all the pieces come together and the tension that builds when the German spy comes to check on things was masterful. Everything fits.I had read the book on this tale at 15 and now at 42 have seen the film for the first time and give it 4 + stars."
__label__2 " An exciting World War II movie: I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
__label__1 " Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story: I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print."
__label__1 " Live Suprise!: This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. I like some Live music but this is not what I wanted. Order a different one."
__label__1 " Wrong item!: After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this."
__label__2 from a doula dad: The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze.
__label__1 " A few good, a lot bad: There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
__label__2 " Ballets of the Forties and Fifties described.: For someone interested in the ballets before 1956 and the ballet companies who danced them, this is for you. This is what happened to the ballet world after Diaghilev's death in 1929. Out of this new world were born the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theater) and the New York City Ballet founded by George Balanchine who got his start with Diaghilev's company."

__label__2 Tight Jam by R.Kelly: this is the direction R.Kelly is going with on his Musical Virus Project.this cut has a cool Jamaican Feel. R.Kelly is channeling elements of Bob Marley&Harry Belefonte on his vocal runs. real smooth joint. this track is so Cool&has a soulful vibe all the way through.I ai't feeling the Re-Mix though. but I like the direction He his taken with going in different directions.this is a Classic Kells Jam.

__label__1 " This Is Crap: If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. Cristina is great but this cd is obviously taken from vinyl and sounds horrible. You can actually hear the record static and the high hats will hurt your ears. I'm going to return mine."
__label__2 " It was a fiction book...: I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book.

__label__1 " Way too many ads: In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read."
__label__2 Men's Fitness: Men's Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. It was easy to read on the kindle fire also.
__label__2 fitness: It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
__label__1 " Cancelled Subscription: I've been a long time subscriber to Men's Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. I have an android based tablet with the Kindle App and it would be great to read online and keep previous issues without taking up space. Unfortunately, Amazon/Men's Fitness does not support their Android based Kindle app, so I cancelled the subscription."
__label__2 " Great magazine: Loaded with workout tips and guides (even if you think you know it all). Focuses on working out and not on the normal crud that fills the others - if I wanna know ""10 pickup lines that work 90% of the time, every time"" then I can pickup one of those other magazines that by the title you'd think would be focusing on working out, but is filled with fluff!"
__label__1 " Six months past, I never get the magazine.: I never get my magazine, it turns out to be the company got the wrong address. So i have to wait another 4~5 months to get my magazine. I can't get my magazine until June or July. Making me so upset!"
__label__1 " Don't Order this product: The magizine itself was good with the one issue they sent. I only received one issue then did not receive another. I ordered in June and now it's September. I received one Magazine. I contacted Men's Fitness Customer Support who said they would reply in 24-48 hours and it's now been a week in a half with nothing. I used to receive Men's Health and I am now going to make the switch. It's more money, but they actually show up each week. Very bad Customer Service. I would not recommend this to anyone."
__label__1 Awful Service: Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
__label__2 " Not as good as it once was: I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars."
__label__1 " Its all shell.: This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing."
__label__1 " Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.: Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
__label__1 Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer: I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
__label__1 " Don't waste your time: I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
__label__1 " Really bad!: This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
__label__1 " Not good: This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. I was disapointed, would not reccomend getting this book"
__label__1 " Required for course: This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover."
__label__2 " Hidden Gem!!: After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"
__label__1 " Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN: This is by far the worst book I have ever read on this topic. People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good."
__label__1 " False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."
__label__1 " An abomination: I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."
__label__2 " Review of False Intimacy: The book, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it's content is truly amazing and informative. Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!"
__label__2 " Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band ."
__label__2 Great DVD: I have had the video tape of this Roxy Music performance for years. I watched it a lot but the tape was old and I was very pleased to find it on DVD in its origional form. If you like Roxy Music this is a 5 star performance.
__label__1 " doesn't come with what's pictured......: Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised."
__label__2 " Thought Provoking...Interesting: This book raises questions of conspiracy with its story of how history is altered according to the times and whims (?) of the few. I recommend this book for anyone studying history, and anyone who wants to know ""the truth."""
__label__1 " Meh.: Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys."
__label__1 " totally unnecessary: this product is ridiculous... all you need to remove garlic smell from hands is to rub your hands on ANY stainless steel item under running water. just about any knife in your kitchen will work, as will pots, cutlery, the sink itself, etc."
__label__1 " I don't think this works...: I bought 4 of these to distribute as gifts to my mother, sister, sister in law and myself. We all cook with tons of garlic and I thought it would be the perfect gift. We tried using the eggs after a day of intense cooking and it didn't seem to work. Ours hands still smelled of garlic and onions."
__label__2 " Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno: Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
__label__2 " Handy lil mp3 player: I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have."
__label__1 " Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
__label__2 " Delivers what it promises.: Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, ""Creative Projects."" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the ""Tickle me Lego"" toy, to fun things for adults like ""Machine with Minifig,"" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation. I especially liked the internet resources listed in the back.CONS:Projects are not laid out in step-by-step detail in the book. (They are on the CD-ROM)."
__label__1 " Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided: I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT."
__label__1 " Character sheets with different pictures: Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
__label__2 " great material hampered by poor layout: Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."
__label__1 " Poor scholarship: This book is another example of ""hands-off"" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources. In summary, in deciding whether to purchase this book---pass!"
__label__2 " Helpful Book on Pastors Changing Churches: Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person. Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject."
__label__2 " Good To Go: This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album."
__label__1 Predictable and Unrealistic: I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
__label__2 most intense book i've ever read !!!: I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
__label__2 " One of the all time best reads ever!: I read this maybe 20 years ago, and have to read it again. SOOO good, so intense, scary, awesome!! Great plot twist. It should have been a bestseller!!"
__label__1 " Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny: I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
__label__2 Disturb not the dream: I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
__label__2 " Old favorite: i first read this book back in the 1980s and loved it. Unfortunately, I lent the book to a friend and never got it back. Always wanted to read it again but I could never find it in any stores. Was able to find it on Amazon, ordered it and thoroughly enjoyed rereading it."
__label__2 " From the lyrics to the chords, this album is full of talent: These Anaheim boys know how to rock my world. Their music is upbeat, fun and easy to dance to. I definitely recommend checking it out and while you're at it, check out their website (mysuperhero.com) If you like music with style you'll love My Superhero!!!"
__label__2 " This book should be on our shelves as Pastors: I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."
__label__2 Awesome baby prunes!: My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
__label__2 " Historical and family content a MUST READ!!!: I loved this book. It has a great historical content to the founding of our nation, as well as the beginning of the LDS church. It has photos and letters spanning four generations, and amazing stories throughout. I particularly loved the letters during the war of 1812. For our family, it's particularly a touching memoir as it is our direct ancestor line. It is not only a must read, but we are purchasing additional copies for our children to have when they are grown. Beautifully written, and well researched. It doesn't get better than this!"
__label__1 " Do not read this book!: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated."
__label__1 SUTURE SELF: Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
__label__2 " Mysterious hospital deaths: Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series."
__label__1 " Time to quit series!: I have read each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful. But I will pass on the Bed & Breakfast series from now on."
__label__2 " get what you pay for: Fine item, does what it needs to, the wires are small but works just fine. If you need a long cable like I did for a chase pipe run, then it works."
__label__2 Early learning toy: My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. The buttons on this toy are easy to push and knobs easy to turn. He was frustrated by his other pop up toy that he could rarely get to work with his tiny hands. This allows his cognitive abilities to develop even before his fine motor skills would be ready to use other toys.
__label__1 " Requires too much strength for toddlers: The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen ""reward"" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required."
__label__2 Great easy toy: My twins love this toy. They can use it on their own and it only makes small noises. The only down side is one seems to get his finger in the way when he pushes the tops down. I love the quality of tolo toys.
__label__1 not safe and no fun: once you get this toy in your hands you can see the cheap construction--the buttons don't work smoothly and the egg-tops are easy to pull off: just the right size for my toddler to pop in his mouth! i chucked this one right in the garbage....
__label__1 " Of little interest: My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough."
__label__2 She is a good singer.: Stacie Orrico is a good singer. She has a God given talent. Even though her ways have changed she always has the ability to sing.
__label__1 " ""eh"" What was I thinking?: Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."
__label__2 " An excellent debut CD!: If you are considering purchasing Stacie Orrico's first CD ""Genuine,"" I would highly recommend it. This CD has a good mix of upbeat songs and sweet, slow tunes. ""Don't Look At Me"" was a big hit on Christian music charts, and for good reason! This is a great song with an awesome message. ""O O Baby"" is a really fun song with a good beat. My personal favorite on the album is ""Dear Friend,"" the final song on the CD, which Stacie wrote herself. It is a song about a friend who doesn't feel good about herself, but Stacie is trying to tell her that she is beautiful and that God loves her no matter what. This song has a beautiful melody and a powerful message. I highly recommend this CD. :-)"
__label__2 " Stacie rocks!!!!!!: This CD is a must buy.It has awesome mixture of pop and R&B.Stacie Orrico has a beautiful, powerful voice.This CD is for anyone who likes Britney or Christina but hates their lyrics.My favorite songs are, ""Don't Look at Me"",""Stay True"",and Genuine""."
__label__2 The Best: This is the best CD ever. The sound of Stacie Orrico's voice is great and the lyrics are great. You would nt excpect such a great sound from a 14 year old but she definitely pulls it off. The songs are suprisingly very pop-like.
__label__2 " So Cool!: This CD is great! It's lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as ""Dear Friend"" and ""Everything I Have"" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track ""Stay True"""
__label__2 " Awesome CD!!: Stacie Orrico is one talented teenager! I have to say, I was very surprised to find she was so young! I think it's wonderful and refreshing to have someone like Stacie Orrico in Christain Music. It sort of puts the ""life"" into the Christain Music for the average young person (or young at heart!:) who may find other Christain groups a bit dull or the music outdated. I bought this CD about a month ago and I can't stop listening to it. My daughter loves it too. I think the best songs are ""Without Love"", and ""Restore My Soul"". I didn't like every song at first, but they have a wonderful message and a catchy tune and I love them all now. If you like Christina Aguilara and Mariah Carrey, you'll LOVE Stacie Orrico."
__label__2 Satisfied: I paid 50 cents for this. Which was not bad at all. It was in good conditions for the price. One of the song did skip a little. But over all it was great for the price.
__label__2 " WONDERFUL: I Love this CD. She is a great witness and all of her songs a great.Ride(9/10)very catchyDon't look at me(15/10)I love this song. It is definitely one of my favroites.O.O Baby(7/10)a little hard to understand but still good.Without Love(10/10)A song with a great tune and a great message.Stay True(20/10)my favroite Stacie Orrico song (you have to hear it to understand, but trust me its great)Genuine(10/10)A song that is genuinely great. A really great sound.With a little Faith(9/10)A good message and it's fun.So Pray(10/10)a great message. It is bold but she does a great job with it.

Not as up-beatConfidant(10/10) I Love the tune and words.Everthing(6/10)Sweet but not very catchy.Dear Friend(13/10)A song that came from her heart and she wrote it her self which I really admire."
__label__2 " this cd is tight: Stacie Orrico is Christian's Britney Spears. (Thats not a bad thing though!!). This album is worth the money because this girl can sing. My fave tracks on here are: Ride, O.O. Baby (my fave song!!), Without Love, Genuine, So Pray, Restore My Soul, Confidant, and Dear Friend. The rest of the tracks are so-so. But get her CD anyway, and go get her X-mas album too!!"
__label__2 " Totally Awesome!: Stacie Orrico is the best. Honestly, I downloaded all of her songs on Napster and I loved it. I loved the cd so much, I decided to buy the cd and support her so She will bring out new albums. Family Christian review says She is Destiney's Child with a Christian theme. I personally think along the lines of Aguilera with a Christian Theme. I am always glad to see young teen artist take a stand for Christ. Some of my favorite songs of hers are Don't Look at me, Stay True, and Dear Friend. I find myself putting their songs on repeat alot. If you want peak at her cd, goto http://www.launch.com/music/artistpage/1,4391,1048259,00.html(vocals included) or http://www.stacieorrico.com/ (just music, no vocals). And Rememeber, If your looking for perfection, don't look at (wo)men, Look at Him."
__label__2 " Pretty Darn Good Stuff: I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone."
__label__2 " skeptical about pop music...: i'm usually really skeptical about pop music. if that pop sound is comin' outa the radio, ya gotta listen to the lyrics! Stacie sounds alot like Christina agulara, but i often question christina's meaning behind her lyrics, like in Genie in a bottle ""if ya wanna be with me"" and ""ya gotta rub me the right way"" really make me ask questions. when i listen to Stacie's album i know that what i'm listening to is clean and pleasing to God. this is defenitly the cd to buy, because everybody knows that you eventually memorize what you listen to no matter if you mean to or not. that also influences your thoughts. don't ask any more questions, just buy this cd right now!"
__label__2 " Is this Christina??: This CD is amazing! Her voice talent is amazing! She will remind you of Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, I also feelA little bit of Mariah Carey in this CD! I would reccomend it to any one!"
__label__1 " Great Saw At First But Don't Use Too Often: I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. Everything on it worked great. A couple of months later the handle to tighten the miter adjustment stripped out. I ordered replacement parts from Makita and received them in a very timely fasion. Shortly after that it stripped again so I made my own replacement parts that work much better. Unfortunately other cheap plastic parts on it are starting to fail and fall apart. I am a big believer in Makita tools and own many for my contracting business, but I strongly suggest buying a different saw. The best part on the saw is the folding stand which I now use to hold my old De Walt rack and pinion table saw."
__label__1 " disappointing read: Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
__label__2 " A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance.: Bob Holtel captures the essence of all essential ingredients that combine to produce an envied athletic endurance achievement. For anyone who has rested on their own laurels of completing a marathon or two, only they can truly appreciate Bob's accomplishment - Running four consecutive marathons every week, 12 weeks straight for three consecutive summers, on uneven rocky trails and at altitude!!! The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account. As an athlete I am honored to have shared the adventure. This book has produced a new hero who has proved again that with vision, preparation, planning and courage you can accomplish your dreams."
__label__2 " A pleasure to read!: This book really is a must have for the PCT collector. This was a sweet read and I'd recommend it. I'd love to know this man, seems like a real gem of a guy. He had good running on the trail, made a great read."
__label__1 " New meaning to the term ""thin""!: Description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement. More like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers. Made in China of only 74% down. To state that this comforter has a retail price of $160 is laughable! Really more of a throw than a comforter. At $50 it is grossly overpriced! Look elsewhere!"
__label__2 " Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal."
__label__2 " Lightweight and Warm: The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
__label__2 " ok for the price: This comforter is ok for the price.its nto 100% down , so expect some mix.but overall , nice to have a extra ,maybe in the guestroom or so.Overall satisfied."
__label__2 " Stands the test of time: This was a very good read. I felt the same ""distancing"" from my husband that Betina did for the same reasons; kids, life, social expectations.The book stands up in todays world, just as it did back in 1967."
__label__2 I wont have that husband!!: This is a fabu book...all young women can learn from this book...this is the man NOT to marry...
__label__2 Good Read!: Diary of a Mad Housewife is a really enjoyable read. It's funny and true. It has a lot to say about life and I would recommend this book to any woman looking for a fun read!
__label__2 Great mastery of domestic details...: makes me feel that I understand Tina's life across time and space. For any woman who looks at her life and wonders what happened.
__label__1 " very basic self talk: This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer."
__label__2 " Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life: Michael J. Russ empowers you to let go of unsupportive self-talk and make supportive self-talk your second nature.

__label__1 " This is not the screenplay: This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. If you are looking for the script for the 1987 film, keep looking."
__label__2 Really makes a difference: Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
__label__2 " His Second Album: Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (""Chicken Truck"" and ""I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal""). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase."
__label__2 " real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. John Anderson is the real deal. This is what country sounds like without the glitter. Drawing from originals like Lefty Frizzell, Anderson's vocals are authentic; haunting on the sad songs. Great musicianship. I highly recommend it."
__label__1 " a good historical book: if you like history books read this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afro\amer. after the civil war"
__label__2 Great Smoke Taste: Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
__label__2 Bradley Special Blend Bisquettes 48 pack: These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great.
__label__2 Good flavor to meat.: The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
__label__2 Woodlands Smoker: Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. The burn thoroughly and produce great smoke for the perfect taste. Everyones loves the result.
__label__2 " Awesome Product!: We love our smoker and we love the smoker chips/bisquettes! The Bradley Cherry Bisquettes add a great flavor to Chicken, pork and beef! They are cheaper on Amazon than at Bass Pro or Cabelas."
__label__2 Bradley Pecan Bisquettes: They worked as advertised . I have used and enjoyed the flavor they impart to the meat . I also enjoy the apple flavor
__label__2 " A great comfort: Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe."
__label__1 " Worst CD I bought in 5 years: I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""
__label__1 " Gimme a break: This is ridiculously preachy stuff. I can tolerate a bit of leftiness in my folk, I find the sincerity touching, but this is too over the top to listen to all the way through more than once."
__label__1 " Spare us the Preachy Folk Crap!: Ry Cooder is an incredible musician, but that does not automatically make you a great songwriter or a great album maker. He should stick to instrumental and soundtrack music, something he's good at."
__label__1 " quite boring...: I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
__label__1 " Buddy: I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all."
__label__2 " Warms the heart.: I am not American. Nor do I usually buy this kind of music. I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there. Its simple messages warm the heart. If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music."
__label__2 " Ry's best work: This is an amazing disc. Much like his early work (Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, etc.), this song cycle recreates the dust bowl era in modern sonic terms and musical language. It combines folk, jazz, blues, and protest songs into a charming, intelligent and entertaining mixture. If you are a fan of classic American music and clever storytelling, then this is the CD for you. It's the aural equivalent of some of Steinbeck's novels (`The Grapes of Wrath' and `Travels With Charlie' come to mind), crossed with `The Wind in the Willows'. That may sound like an odd mixture, but the results are wonderful.As in the best American folk music of the era Cooder is recreating, these songs are political motivated, socially aware and purposefully accessible to a wide group of people. His take on this form would do Woody Guthrie proud. This is the best musical purchase I've made in quite a while."
__label__2 " Ry Cooder: As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30's. He has continually explored the origins of music from Africa to Cuba to Mexico to early America with consumate ease. My Name Is Buddy is only available on import in Australia and not for general release so I am proud to have my copy included in my collection. I trust that he, and others, continue to explore our musical roots and Ry Cooder remains as one of the Four or five artists who have had a profound effect on my musical knowledgePaul Thomas Australia"
__label__2 " Ry Cooder My name is Buddy: I do like the atmosphere on this CD. It brings back memories of the folk mmusic from when I was young (sixties, early seventies. I also like lyrics and his views on society."
__label__2 " Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being ""red,"" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too."
__label__1 " 1 month to ship?: I ordered it on april 11, now it's apr. 29. I just found that it's going to be shipped on May 12th.It is just a trash can. Are you casting this after getting order? custom made? what's wrong with you? I don't cancel this order only because it was supposed to be included in free super saving shipping."
__label__2 " Great product: This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin."
__label__2 " Nice but not the best: I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products."
__label__2 Great for smoothing and repairing sensitive skin: Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. I use this a few nights each week to even out troubled-looking areas. It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.
__label__2 " Fair: It is a very fair tribute to Celia. It's a shame that it was done so late when she wasn't abble to sing as she used to. The singers do well, but it leaves a sad taste to see Celia just sitting and listen to her songs being interpretated by others."
__label__2 " Excellent: So interesting! This product is excellent. I recomend it.This CD is excellent!....Try it, try it...you will see Love Celia and all the artists!"
__label__1 " DVD CON PROBLEMAS: ESTE DVD LLEGO EN BUEN TIEMPO. SIN EMBARGO, SE FREEZA EN LA CANCION NUMERO 1 INTERPRETADA POR VICTOR MANUEL, UNA DE LAS MEJORES."
__label__1 Regret Purchase: It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. I expected more based on the reviews and I was very disappointed.
__label__2 " The best of recent books on Wordsworth and Coleridge.: Eilenberg's book opens the complex and fascinating topic of intellectual property, in addition to providing brilliant readings of the major poems of these two seminal Romantic poets."
__label__1 " Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book: This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'"
__label__2 " World Encyclopedia of Bread: Excellent book for beginners. A must for anyone who wants to fresh taste of home made bread. Excellent photographs and guidelines. Included also is method for adapting recipes for bread machines. As the name says it recipes from all over the world like England, Mediterranean and Asia are discussed, not to mention the American and festive type breads. I love it & sure that you will too"
__label__1 " Worst dubbing ever!: Fast beat motivating music. Average workout. But the dubbing is so bad as to be comically distracting. Might be better if you speak German, but with English dubbing, it's intolerable."
__label__2 " camco wrench: This is a great tool. Due to arthritis, I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely. This enabled me to insert the plug(a replacementmetal one)with no leaks!"
__label__1 " Inaccurate description: My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better."
__label__2 " an almost necessary tool.: I could easily have made this tool, but I'm getting lazy in my old age. It beats using a pair of channel locks, and much neater."
__label__1 " Wasn't what I wanted: This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight."
__label__1 " The ad didn't say what size this thing was: I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Since there was no choice of size, I assumed one size fits all. Well, unfortunately, one size does not fit all and this drain plug is too small for my drain plug."
__label__1 " Did Not Work For Me: Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate."
__label__2 plastic tool: works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic
__label__2 Did not fit my Coleman E3: This appears to be perfectly fine as long as it fits. I guess the Coleman E3 does not use a standard fitting so it does not fit.
__label__2 great stuff: These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
__label__2 " Chore Boy Golden Fleece: I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Then, once they get old, after a month or two, they ""graduate"" to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks! Now that I am an adult, I can't stop using them. I even have my husband hooked! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops, so I ordered them...and got a great deal!"
__label__2 " Golden Fleece is the BEST: Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!"
__label__2 " Raised body temperature and metabolism: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."
__label__1 " not a healthy product: I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk."
__label__1 " It made me gain weight.: This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just ""guggul"". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them."
__label__1 " Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!: 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."
__label__1 " Should put his talent to better use....: Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only."
__label__1 What happened to Larry Carlton?: The elevator has arrived. Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!
__label__2 " What's with all the complaining?: Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars."
__label__1 " Larry's Careful New Album: I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."
__label__1 " The obligatory contractual album: It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of ""talk a lot but say nothing"". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass."
__label__2 " Chrysler/Blower: This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly. Haven't had any problems, but it has been in the vehicle only about a month.I would buy from this distributor again, especially since their price is half of what a car dealer wanted."
__label__1 " Crap: This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!"
__label__1 " the movie rocks, BUT...: ... sometimes it's nice to see that, indeed sometimes we germans clearly get better editions of some movies than you americans do. and in this case, the german company E-M-S did a very cool 2-disc Special Edition of Perdita Durango (original title) with the original english soundtrack. so I'd recommend this edition to all you americans with region-free-players, 'cause THIS FILM ROCKS UNCUT!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__1 " Didint understand much: I'm not sure what the plot was for this movie, I really don't know what i got the movie either maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don't know but wasn't all that great."
__label__1 Dance with the Devil: This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
__label__1 " A Waste of a Picture: This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?...."
__label__1 " A Piece of Trash: This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far. It also depicts Mexicans as cult members and grotesque.It places people in the Caribbean speaking with a Castillian accent. A real piece of trash and mentally disturbing."
__label__1 " So bad.: This movie is so violence and so evil. It 's for those who love sex, drugs, etc. Children must beware of."
__label__1 " Great movie, but...: This is a great work by Alex de la Iglesia, but sadly this edition (""unrated"") has been butchered by A-pix. Many shots have been removed or replaced by video generated titles.Also, one of the high and emotional moments of the ending has been completely removed.If you can't get the original version, get this one. You will enjoy it because it is still a great movie. I give this edition only one star because I can't accept loosing that key moment at the end."
__label__1 " Be aware!: Don't blow 35 bucks on this because it says it's ""unrated"", here. They're ALL UNRATED, and you can find the same thing for just a few bucks elsewhere on this site!"
__label__2 " Miller's overlooked art: Steve Miller is probably the world's most underated guitarist. He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong ""Little Girl"" and the civil rights motif ""Don't you let nobody"" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. ""Baby's House"" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. ""Motherless Children"" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it. If not, you might want to start off his early stuff with Antholgy."
__label__2 THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE: Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
__label__1 " I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem: I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results"
__label__1 " Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally."
__label__2 " WONDERFUL BOOK: If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!"
__label__2 " VERY TEEN-MUSIC CD: I really Like This CD because I like this kind of ""Teen Music"". It seems Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera with a bad day and Enrique Iglesias... Its Just a GOOD CD.ME PIERDO JUNTO A TI: A VERY GOOD song, I love it. (9/10)VAS A VOLVERME LOCA: Good, but not the best from the CD. (7/10)LA LECCI�N: One of the best songs. (10/10)LA NOCHE LLEG�: Very ""Enrique Iglesias Style"". (8/10)NO SOY UN �NGEL: Not very bad...but too Machine (6/10)NADIE COMO T�: VERY GOOD. Too Romantic (10/10)UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD: ��GOOD!! (7/10)TU ME SALVASTE AYER: So...Funny!!! (9/10)DONDE EST�S EL CIELO ESTAR�: It's not very bad...(6/10)ESC�CHAME: VERY VERY GOOD! (10/10)ENGLISH TRACKS: Not very bad at all...but in English. (6/10)"
__label__2 " Brimful of Styles: We already knew that Cornershop represented a unique brew of styles. This single goes two steps further. ""Sleep"" is remixed in a 1983 New Wave style sure to evoke memories of Thomas Dolby and Falco. Norman Cook's incomparable mix of ""Asha"" is already world-famous, own it for 10 bucks less than the import."
__label__1 " Not Impressed: Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching.The menu doesn't work! I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
__label__1 " Rip Off: First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."
__label__2 " An Acquaintance with darkness: A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it."
__label__2 " Pretty Good: I really liked this book! It is a Classic ""Rinaldi"". I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of ""dark"". It is not a real ""happy"" book to read although it is very good."
__label__2 " Excellent content, Very easy reading, Historically correct!: I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much. It was nice to have the author describe in detail at the end where the actual fact ended and where the fiction began. You really understood why Emily was confused and felt for the country at the loss of the President. I would highly recommend this book for everyone from middle school age thru adult!"
__label__1 " An Aquaintance with Darkness: Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance."
__label__2 This book was Phnomenal: This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
__label__2 " The Madness of Life: In this book Emily's world crumbles beneath her feet when her mother dies. She goes with her uncle instead of to her friend's (Annie) house like her mother and she had planned. After all of this she decides to stay in control of her life. By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book. I like it also because it was based on the truth and I like how the book ended, I guess you could say it was a different ending."
__label__2 " One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."
__label__1 " Dark is right!: A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."
__label__2 " Truly an ""Acquaintance With Darkness"": This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic. The book makes the characters realistic. It is haunting and morbid. I would suggest this book for anyone who would like a most creative and intersting view on the Civil War."
__label__2 " First thought, bummer, as I read on more like Bravo!!!: The first paragraph or so , it was like Mrs. Rinaldi you can do better but as I read on I was like I take that back. I totally fell into the Washington D.C. backdrop. If I had to recommend this book to a person I'd also tell them this: you can't stop at just one of her books."
__label__2 " A Very Suspenseful Book!: This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it."
__label__2 This book was very good I loved the suspense: there wasn't enough romance though.I wish her books were longer
__label__1 " A Disappointment: I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
__label__1 Poor!: I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing! Just a lame tone to follow along with.
__label__2 " Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' ""The Highwayman"" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like ""The Highwayman"" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Watch by Moonlight"". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."
__label__2 " A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book. It helped my find the right cage, told me about dangerous toys, first aid, different species, etc. This book contains everything, if you only want to buy one book on lovebirds, make it this one. This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection. I am looking forward to the arrival of my first baby lovebird, and because of this book, I feel confident and at ease that I can provide a safe and loving home for my bird."
__label__2 " Excellent book for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!"
__label__2 " Good book for pet owners, but not breeders: If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)"
__label__2 " Smooth and cool, like the anime series!: This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent."
__label__2 " Vitaminless?: The version of this CD that includes ""Vitaminless"" is a bootleg. It'll be from ""Sonmay"" or ""Everanime"" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks."
__label__1 " Not woryh a plug nickle: Useless, just a junk kit. Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item. If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it, I would refuse it! Junk!"
__label__1 Not what it claimed to be: The pic was so small - couldn't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all. I didn't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses. How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses.
__label__1 " okay: the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses. the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in,even with someone else helping me. you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop. but i do like the keychain."
__label__1 " Typical Imported Product: The case is pretty much useless. Nothing stays in the small compartments. I really dont know why they exist. The small screwdriver, both flathead & phillips are cheap material. You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws."
__label__2 " Nice kit: Everything you need to fix your glasses. Nice kit. Don't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits, you'll still be left with broken shades. Indulge (haha) in the 6 dollar kit and you'll be right as rain."
__label__1 Screws do not have heads!: I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver. They looked loke little threaded rivets? No way to use them without a way to turn the screw. Quality rip off.
__label__2 " Must Have foer Anyone with Glasses or Sunglasses: I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses (won't buy expensive ones ever again) and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out. Everytime I needed a repair it was $5-$10 but with this kit, I do it myself and that was worth the money!"
__label__1 " Doesn't smell like plumeria...unusable: This product smells disgusting, not like plumeria products I have bought. If you like plumeria, do not buy ... ... ... ..."
__label__2 " Nice lighter version of Tresor: This is a nice lighter version of Tresor for the summer. I've enjoyed it, although it does not smell just like Tresor."
__label__2 Good Enough I'm Looking for the Author: Help! My cousin in Brazil is trying to contact the author of this book. The letter he sent was returned to him as the address being no good. He had gotten the address out of the back of the book. Does anyone know how to contact the author?
__label__1 Fox Collection: The Great Fox War Movies (Patton - Special Edition / The Longest Day / Tora! Tora! Tora! - Special Edition)I purchased this set and the DVD's (6) Were Damaged. I requested a replacement. The Replacement was also damaged. The problem is the DVD's are in paper inserts in the Book. They are not protected. In the packaging process by FOX ( Not Amazon ) The DVD's get all scratched and will not play.
__label__2 " Can't vouch for content, but packaging is really nice: As I said in the title, I can't vouch for the content as this was purchased as a gift for my Dad. However, the packaging is great. I thought Amazon made a mistake and sent a book instead of the DVD package, but it turned out to be BOTH a book and the DVD's (guess I should have read the description better). In any case, I know they are classic movies and this deluxe presentation will make an impressive gift."
__label__1 " Not the best deal...: Do yourself a favor and buy the special two disk editions of each of these movies separately. You won't get the book, but you'll save almost $50 off the price of this set. Unless of course the book is worth the extra fifty to you... It certainly isn't to me."
__label__2 " classic bit of entertainment: Adventure movie based on book, pretty much plot for plot. Set in Scotland, very late 60s, very cynical portrayals. And some stock pieces that have stuck in my memory clearly from when I first saw it in 1970. Holds its own, and the Wally Stott music hangs in the memory as well."
__label__1 " Not the best choice...: Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted."
__label__1 " AAARGH!: Avoid this game. I was gobsmacked to read the positive reviews on this game.There is little direction, you are left to wander about huge levels with chance bringing you across the necessary switch. The 4th level has caused me just to walk away from the game (Confluence). I cannot find a way out of the inital 3 levels. An online Game site I found said it was a bug so I downloaded an 80mb patch and had to replay from begining. Still no luck. Gamesite gave it 2.7 out of 10.The plot sounds great but is awful in reality - the script is like a 50's B movie and rather than guiding into suspicion about the Corporation ejects you into the Ressistance with the speed and elegance as a bad case of diorrea.I came across these reviews while trying to find BestBuys policy on returns of Software. ..."
__label__1 " Worst 3D shooter I ever played: I paid $2 for this at Gamestop. It is worth about $-30, (yes, that is NEGATIVE $30), because I wasted three hours of my life. Most of that three hours was spent working as a JANITOR, where nothing fun is happening.Most of the game play is spent walking around in circles in empty areas looking for the correct way out. Very boring. Enemies are not fun to fight. My favorite was the huge level with invisible enemies. How fun is it to spend hours going over the same layout again and again while looking for INVISIBLE creatures.This could be the worst game I ever played.Yes, I was stuck forever at the eco-dome, because there the door out wouldn't open. I think that might have been the bug referred to earlier.Do not buy this game."
__label__2 " To the point: Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it's a thick book - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e.g. classic Nordic skis or 3-pin tele's. Alpine riders seeking vertical ft look for George Hurchalla's book."
__label__1 " A disappointment: This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money."
__label__2 " WIll work with new drivers: My brother and I have had to split our time on the internet for a while. (He has a desktop which uses an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, while I have a laptop which requires the ethernet cable to be plugged into an airport) So for Christmas, I decided to give him a gift that would please me as well, this wireless adapter. The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work. Finally, my brother found some way to install new drivers for the PCI card. After he did this, it worked fine. I hope this review helps anyone that might be having similar troubles."
__label__2 " Not ready for Windows seven: Had great connection and was REALLY fast. It was not ready for windows 7 tho, it doesn't has the drive for it yet!"
__label__2 " Works Great: I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great."
__label__2 " A little trouble connecting but works fine: I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. It took me over an hour to finally connect, but I don't think this is the fault of the product, just my computer. I have been connected for about 5 minutes now and it works great =). The signal's good (I'm 40 or 50 ft from the wireless router and signal strength jumps between 91% and 95%) and It's about just as fast as my other computer with a physical internet connection. I would recommend it if you're looking for something cheap that works."
__label__2 " Really good value for the money: I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don't currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem.I picked this card based on the rating and reviews here. I am happy to say that they were very accurate and this is a really good card, especially given that the price is so low compared to other, brand name cards.Installation was very simple and the signal strength and speed are perfect. I was in a hurry so I just used the Windows wireless client instead of the dedicated, included software but perhaps if I get time later, I will try running that.All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this card - right price and very good performance."
__label__2 " Satisfied Customer: I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house. I'm surprised that I get 75-80 percent signal strength from where I am, which was way less that my last one that had the small antenna attached directly to the pci card. All I can say is the price and the product are both awesome."
__label__2 " Vista Home Premium 64-bit SP1 easy install: After reading past reviews, I was prepared to have to download special 64-bit drivers to make this card work with Vista 64-bit. But they weren't needed: Vista 64 automatically got the drivers from Windows Update, and I was connected to my WPA network in minutes. Never needed the MSI installation disk or the drivers I'd downloaded.Card itself works find, excellent signal strength. The little antenna is fine, although I may wind up velco-ing it to the case."
__label__2 " Stable and fast!: I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts. Works great on my 64-bit system. There are no cons to this card. Buy it while it is still available. Other sites are out of stock!!!!"
__label__2 leet product: This thing can pick up signals better than anything I have used. It gets a better signal than the Linksys or Buffalo router functioning as a wireless bridge (via DD-WRT or Tomato). Installation is just like any other windows device. Extremely stable connection even with crappy routers.
__label__2 " Easiest route I have ever installed!: I noted the opinions of previous raters of this product and decided to give it a try.Not only was delivery fantastically quick, but the wireless card installed instantly and required no configuration by me! So nice to buy something that installs easily and works well."
__label__2 " Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...: Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating."
__label__2 Works Good.: I Bought this card for a third computer in my house and its the ferthest from the router and works fine.
__label__2 " Fastest so far!: Bought this to install in a 40 Gig, HP Pentium 4 hard drive government surplus computer that is about 2-3 years old. Other than having trouble connecting it with my QWest wireless service (it wouldn't show in the little box they kept telling me to click on even though the wireless card properties said ""the device is working properly""), I got it to connect anyway and this computer now has the fastest internet in the house! It is faster than my brand new Dell that I got last year. I am recommending it to my parents who bought similar surplus computers after seeing how fast the internet was on this computer. I don't think it is the computer though, I think it is the wireless card! It was easy to install, too (and I have never installed anything in a tower before). I am very pleased with it, esp. for the price!"
__label__1 " Weak Signal: I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!"
__label__2 " GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!: This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome."
__label__1 did not work: The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
__label__2 " Very Fast Wireless Card: I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. With the computer in the same room as my wireless card I don't even need to use the antenna. I am very impressed and it has worked flawlessly for me."
__label__2 " Works with Vista 64: I loaded this up today and out of the box it did not work with vista 64, I had to go on another computer and go to MSI's website to get the vista 64 drivers. Once I had those I ran them and the card works great. Only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 is because while using this to game I lag for about 1 second every couple of minutes, it's just enough to be a pain."
__label__2 " Works with XP 64!!!!: I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. I tried two different USB devices and three different PCI devices and none of them worked until this product. What a great price too. I put it in loaded the software and BAM! it work perfectly. Very cool how some thing just work and for about one third the price of all those other devices that I tried. My only complaint would be the 18"" external antenna. I wish it was one of the folding ones that comes attached. Oh well.... I'm just happy to be finished and not have to return any more stuff because it doesn't work."
__label__2 Works great: This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
__label__2 " Works Great!: This little card installs flawlessly on Windows 7 and then just works like a champ. Great connectivity while connecting to a Linksys WRT54G from a fairly difficult location (downstairs and across the house!). Very happy with it, especially at this price,"
__label__2 " Easy to install...cheaper than buying directly from Dell!: This card is a breeze to install, fits right into the slot in my Dell PC. Dell was asking for $50 for pretty much the same card, preinstalled. Saved a bundle. Couldn't be happier. No issues with Windows, no problems with connection speed. Certainly recommend this product."
__label__2 " Good product. Recommended.: This works as well as the other reviewers suggested. Easy installation if you've opened up your cpu before and exchanged a pci card before. The antenna has good range, and I was connected in minutes to my wireless router. Thanks a lot."
__label__2 " Reliable, Fast, and Inexpensive.: I've burned through 4 different types of USB Internet dongles and a few PCMCIA cards of all brands. Only one dongle works now and it's from Trendnet. So I decided to go with PCI cards for wireless internet. The first one I got was for my wife. It was a good deal until they doubled the price when I needed a few more. Trolling Amazon I went. After reading all of the reviews, I settled on this card. I purchased two and they work flawlessly. One is connected 24/7 to the Internet, my daughter can't miss a beat with Club Penguin, and the other runs an FTP server 24/7. I have had them for a while now, at least 6 months or so, and they work a lot better than most of the USB dongles I've had. I have no issues uploading or downloading huge files from FTP to my HTTP server.It was a good buy."
__label__2 " Great Wireless PCI card: It is a wonderful and for the price, nothing can beat it.I had other USB adapters installed before and never have great reception as this does.Highly recommend.The MSI software needs a little attention but if you follow the procedures, you should be fine. Took no more than 15 minutes to get every thing ironed out."
__label__1 " Incompatible with windows7: OK, I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. The official website doesn't have a driver for windows 7. It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur. Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router, but 80% of the time, the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is ""server not found"". It's on its way back to amazon. If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it's out, avoid this card as best as you can."
__label__1 " antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION"
__label__1 Not Worth It: This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
__label__1 Doesn't work: This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY!: 1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
__label__1 " Keeps dropping the connection.: I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon."
__label__2 " Works great on Vista 64-bit: NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network.Didn't even need the enclosed drivers. Vista 64-bit connected the device without a hitch and it's been working flawlessly for about 1 year.EDIT 09/24/2011This device also works great with Linux Ubuntu 10.04..."
__label__1 " crc receive errors: Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution."
__label__2 " Significant improvement over my USB wireless: I had a USB wireless adapter that got 50-60% signal strength. This this adapter, I get around 90%. I've absolutely no problems with this card and have been impressed by it's performance."
__label__2 " works well: does as advertised. Bought this because of current reviews and it's great. I have to ""repair"" the connection about once every 2 weeks on the machine being used with this card, but I never have to repair the connection on my other computer. Not sure why this is, but it's a really fast fix and never causes problems."
__label__2 " Works as advertised: Good product, works just as described. Easy to install. Have not had any problems thus far."
__label__2 Simple Installation: I received and installed this last night on my kids 4 year old HP desktop. It is a replacement for the Buffalo wireless USB adapter the kids broke a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to get a replacement Buffalo product but found that a court injunction now bars Buffalo from selling many of their products in the US.I installed the Super G and it interfaced with the Buffalo router in 30 seconds. No problem at all. It even receives pretty good signals from 5 other wireless networks in my neighborhood. I am no computer geek but will say this product works like a charm with no dropped signals so far.
__label__2 " Excellent signal: A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice."
__label__2 " Talk about plug and play!: I have windows Vista to start with. Installation took all of 5 minutes. I installed the software that came with the product and could not get my PC to recognize the card installed in an empty PCI slot. Went to the manufactures website and sure enough, they had the new software upgrade for VISTA. Installed it and was online instantly. It seems as fast as direct cable hook up. Worth every penny. A great product..."
__label__2 " Works great with Windows 7: Just got this card for my new Windows 7 machine. Worked great after I got the RA link drivers from their website. Seems fast, doesn't lose connections, the antenna seems sturdy. Right now only using it with 802.11b but it seems fast enough!"
__label__2 " Works great!: I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn't dropped signal on me yet"
__label__1 " Does not work with Windows Vista & Airport: Tried and failed to get my pc set up on our Airport 802.11g network. Vista did not recognize the card; XP recognized the card but would only let me join the network when we turned security off. I'm sure that this is a Windows problem more than it is the fault of the wireless card, but still--couldn't get this product to work and now we have to buy another card."
__label__2 " Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2: I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!"
__label__2 " Works Great!: I had a Linksys wireless receiver that was not compatible with Vista, so after upgrading my computer, I found this on Amazon and based on reviews, decided to give it a shot. Worked wonderful right out of the box, and signal strength is excellent! Works like a champ, and easy to install. Highly recommend if you need a Vista compatible connection to your wireless router."
__label__2 Works great: I added this to my windows vista desktop. It seems to work fine. I have been using it for months.
__label__1 " lost settings: Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days."
__label__1 " Total garbage! Software terrible. No support. Don't buy!: I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G."
__label__1 " Works, but with limitations.: This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card."
__label__2 " Works great: This product works really good. My computer is pretty far from any connection, yet it still connects great, and is usually very fast."
__label__2 " It works!: I bought this because my crappy D-link wireless pci adapter was dying only after about 6 months into use. It was dropping connections every 10 minutes or so. Now after I plug this in, I get at least 4 bars compared to average 2-3 bars i used to get with d-link. I saw some users complain about the short antenna. Yes it is pretty short but long enough to get on top of the computer and that alone can make whole lot of difference. Otherwise spend little more money and get more expensive ones. For this price, this one is a steal. Also to anyone who bought/will buy this item. Do yourself a favor, dont use the crappy driver that comes with it. Go to ralink website and download their reference driver."
__label__1 Very Dissapointed: This is a book that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Great Pictures of Bassets. And then it is a general dog Information Book.I was looking for a Book that would be much more specific about Basset Hounds and not a product catalog.
__label__1 " Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets."

__label__1 " Waste of money: This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use."
__label__2 DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!: this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
__label__2 Great product: This is a great product for the price. For a home theater aplication this amp does more than expected. And for the price you just can ask anymore. I got this amp shipped very quickly and received it without any problems all the way in Aruba! The amp has a bunch of preset EQ's so you'll find one that'll fit you. I run these through old but faithfull Pinnacle 200 monitors and some RCA surrounds and the whole set just begs to be played out loud. It's been a while since I felt rumble in the room from such a deep bass. I think it's part amp part speakers. If you match them correctly you won't go wrong.
__label__2 " Outdated but Great for Essays, Papers, and Editing: I value this book since I proofread papers, essays, administrative memos, etc. for clients on liveperson.com and in past careers. This helps for office filing, clerical/administrative basics if you are working on these type of jobs/duties required. I also recommend this book for editing projects and for reference for college papers."
__label__2 " a valuable resource: if you need to have clarity regarding the usage of the written word, this book will be a valuable, easy to use reference."
__label__2 " Simply the best: I teach business writing in industry and government, and I recommend the Gregg Manual enthusiastically in all my programs, at every level. There are a lot of wonderful resources out there, including Albert Joseph's classic EXECUTIVE GUIDE TO GRAMMAR, that can help you understand what makes our language tick, but there is nothing like Gregg when you need an authoritative answer NOW to a specific (even picayune) question. And it's striking to see how EXCITED seemingly well-balanced people from all walks of life can be when they first get their hands on Gregg. After reading the other reviews here, I am even preparing to do the unthinkable and buy a new copy - just to see what the new edition has to say about computers (my copy is a little old...)."
__label__2 Book review: great book a lot better than I excepted. It is now being used in class. quick shipping. very happy. looking for more from that author and related material.
__label__2 " An invaluable style and reference manual for advertising copywriters: This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. There may be a new edition that supercedes this one by the time you read this. if so, I would buy it without reservation. I find myself reaching for this time and again when I write. Highly recommended."
__label__2 " Simply the Best!: Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
__label__1 " Boo! Stay away from this product: Such a great idea, perfect in its simplicity, and yet executed so horribly. This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review on Amazon (I was so worked up I even took pictures and added them to the product description).1. The tactile feel of the product sucks. The buttons should click or at least depress nicely.2. Murky, hard to read numbers. Even when I push down all the way some numbers are still barely legible and I wonder if my daughter will be able to depress the buttons all the way.3. Some of the math is wrong! 1 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 3? This isn't exactly advanced vector calculus and it's THE ONLY THING this product is supposed to do. At least do it right. Even if the company realized the mistake after one million units were produced, they should have the pride to not ship a math product geared exclusively towards kids learning math with bad math on it.1 star, avoid."
__label__1 Hard to see answers under buttons: I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.
__label__2 Perfect for a first grader: great for a child just learning basic math concepts. has really helped my first grader gain an edge with math facts
__label__2 " No batteries calculator!: My husband had these as a kid. If you push the buttons down, the answer becomes visable through the plastic. Durable and great for our kids to practice math with."
__label__2 " Use product in bright light: I bought this toy for my daughter, I remember playing with this at a cousins house as a child. Although, I don't remember having a hard time seeing the numbers as a child. I found that it is best to used to product over a light.. if possible, or in a well lit area. I THINK THE PRODUCT COULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WERE A MINI LIGHT BUILT IN THE BACK OF THE GAME.Durable and fun though."
__label__2 " Great learning toy!: Bought this for my niece, as I had one similar as a child and she loves it as much as I did! It's a fun way to learn addition and subtraction!"
__label__1 " Plus-Minus Chart Toy: Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
__label__1 " Useless: I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
__label__1 out of stock?: When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else. very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again.
__label__1 " Arrogant Author: I found that the style of the book was more about the author showing off his knowlege, rather than presenting the information. There are few examples, and the ones that are there, are poorly explained. There is a severe lack of organization - he just seems to spew information. At times he shows us his humor - not very funny, but the most readable part of the book.He spends too much time bashing C and C++. (Does he think it makes him look smart?) I want to learn Java, not compare it to other languages and think how great I am for using it (like he does). One has to know C++ to understand what he's saying. In general, if you know already OOP and C++ this book will be good for you, otherwise STAY AWAY!!!"
__label__1 " AWESOME Writer - Not updated for all of Java2...: Rushed to press, not all of the Java2 API is included in this volume. I loved Java 1.1 and Beyond, but I wasted my money on this one..."
__label__1 ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER: I got this book for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. I hate this book! Maybe some people who have a little background would like it better.
__label__1 It is pretty bad: I am a computer Science student at the university of new brunswick and i felt that this book was a complete waste of time. The author would introduce new topics and then jump into rather difficult examples with very little explanations. I would recommend that anybody interested in learning java to not buy this book.
__label__1 " A good source of propaganda!: I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
__label__2 " Great book - easy learning: I loved ""Just Java 2"", and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Unlike what one other reviewer wrote, there is no assumption of C++ (It amazes me that people who read a book so superficially feel free to share their wrong assumptions about it). Just Java 2 is well written and easy to follow. The examples are interesting, and the source, the Java FAQ, and a wealth of other info and compilers is on the accompanying CD. Highly recommended!"
__label__1 " Vague: This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
__label__1 " Lacks depth.: This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes."
__label__1 " I am surprised this book is endorsed by SUN: This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter ""FILE I/O"", after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."
__label__1 " Not Practical: This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
__label__1 Its little hard..: The way he used to explain the topics are confusing..I was very excited to buy this book but found it difficult instead of having C and C++ knowledge.
__label__2 Great book...the best one I looked at.: Explanations are clear and concise....which is what I needed. Includes sample code to illustrate points made.
__label__1 " NOT so good: Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly."
__label__2 " The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book."
__label__2 " Just Java 2: Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow."
__label__2 " Not as good as his book ""Deep C Secrets"": I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled ""Deep C Secrets"" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level."
__label__2 " Great book for existing programmers: This book is great for people (like me) who can already program, and just want to learn Java. I found it went at the right pace to get me the info I needed on Java. Most examples are small enough to understand easily, with much bigger ones inc. complete games & applications on the CD. Highly recommended if you want to learn Java, and already know C or Fortran or VB etc"
__label__2 Excellent intro to Java and OOP for newbies.: I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail.
__label__1 " Do not buy this book unless you know C++: I thought I'd be able to learn Java from this book, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the author attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java.I found the book condescending to non C and C++ programmers, and the order of subjects he chooses to teach Java is wierd.If you want to learn Java and don't know C or C++, do not look here, go to Dietel and Deitel's ""Java: How to Program"" instead."
__label__1 " Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this book should have been, ""Java for C/C++ Programmers"". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, ""In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte."" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is ""Core Java, Vol 1"", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."
__label__1 " Not a very thorough book: This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."
__label__1 " Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."
__label__1 very cryptic details: not suited for beginner's should have qiute lucid explationsi dont recommend for new commers to java
__label__1 " very bad book: The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book ""core java 2"" is much better."
__label__1 " Not for true beginners: I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
__label__1 " Please dont buy if you are entirely new to Java Concepts: Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - ""If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO..."" is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."
__label__2 " A Reader from Fremont, CA (near San Francisco).: Just Java 1.2 thought me a lot about programmings. First I used Core Java but now, I like Just Java 1.2 better. JUST JAVA RULES!"
__label__1 " Don't waste your hard-earned money: This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do."
__label__2 " Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book."
__label__1 " Easy to read, but NOT a good reference: Just Java 2 is very readable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. I'd read a chapter and feel like I had a fairly complete understanding. But when I tried to apply what I learned, I always struggled. The problem for me was his examples are way too fragmented and incomplete. I spend lots of time reviewing FAQ sites for descent examples.I would not recommend this book.FYI - I am new to OOP, but relatively experienced with C, ADA, Fortran, ..."
__label__1 " Great for C Gurus...: The back cover mentions it is a book for people with ""programming backgrounds"". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is ""C/C++ expertise"". If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like ""you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference."" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."
__label__2 " Great Activity Book - Cover Questionable: This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking."
__label__1 Cheaply made: Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
__label__2 " I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
__label__2 Costly but good: This trainning pad is the most absorbant I've ever seen. It also attracts your pooch and can be soiled via urine a couple of times before being discarded. You never seem to smell urine and never have to worry about leakage however it is very costly. I have found pads that are much cheaper with slightly less of a quality. After paying high prices for this brand for over a year my eyes are begining to rove to the lesser costly brand.
__label__2 " Excellent movie, poor quality DVD, poor quality video: My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship. You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an ""OK"" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the ""extra"" information isn't. The ""shame on you"" goes to The Richard Diercks Company, Inc., and Simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of ""what not to do"" in DVD production, development, and video transfer."
__label__2 " More than just music: This is one of the best Christian music CDs you can ever find in the music industry. Christian music is different from secular music, and the difference is that Christian musicians are there to praise God, instead of praising themselves for their talent, and to guide listeners' heart and mind to God through music. And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life. It is more than just beautiful. Too bad, there is only 5 stars to rate her. I would give her 10 stars!"
__label__2 " Great CD, Great Artist!: This CD is one that you will never get tired of. Jennifer's talent and sound are incredible. She is one of the most gifted artist's I've ever listened to. I would recommend this CD to anyone and have already bought it as a gift for most of my acquaintances."
__label__2 Jennifer LaMountain: Listening to Jennifer's message and voice is very promising to me! It lift's up my thought's and makes me look foward to our real home with Jesus in Heaven! Beautiful words and music!
__label__2 " Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,"" which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the ""happy ending"" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."
__label__1 " Did not learn much: Instant Immersion French is poor when it comes to teaching you French. I was just unable to learn from this program unlike some other programs which have helped me. Beware this product, I would consider a different company's product over this one. I have also tried French Now by Transparent Language and found that it taught me French quite well."
__label__1 " Really should be zero stars: This product is really a disappointment. There are no menus and no lessons one, two, etc. On CD 1 you learn some basic words and then on CD 2 there is nothing but French. The other CDs are not much more help. I bought this program to learn French and now I'm considering not wasting my time, trashing it and starting again."
__label__1 Worthless: It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
__label__1 " Next time read the item description Edgardo: This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this."
__label__1 " If you like Tozer, you won't like this!: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!"

They performed in Cheyenne, Wyo last summer (looks like they'll be back this year too (can you see me smiling? ) I saw them last September in Estes Park, and they are brilliant !

__label__1 not sufficient after a long day at the computer: I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
__label__2 The Hound of Baskerville: The book is what I would call an intriguing tease. Doyle creates a mood throughout the whole book that keeps the reader sitting on the edge of their seat. I would definitely recommend this book for those readers who like a good mystery.
__label__1 " Missing content is not acceptable - Wake up, Amazon!: Missing content is not acceptable for publishing books, either paper version or digital version! Please fix the problem, Amazon!!!!"
__label__1 Missing Content: this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
__label__1 " Excellent Book; Terrible Kindle Version: The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers. There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories. In a complete version, it's a four-star book."
__label__2 " A nice abridgement: These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks. It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive. My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete. Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it."
__label__2 " The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!: I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
__label__2 " Like Finding an Old Friend: I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old."
__label__2 " Lasts a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is one of the best. It has lasted over a century, having been published in 1901. If you haven't read it, do so today--there haven't been many changes in detective fiction in the last hundred years.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
__label__2 " Male only spaces: I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times."
__label__2 " The Hound of the Baskervilles: The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection. We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book. The book itself is, of course, a ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people. The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text."
__label__2 " Top Rate Holmes..........: Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"
__label__1 " The Hound of the Baskervilles: This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."
__label__1 " Missing substantial passages on Kindle version: I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."
__label__1 The Hound of the Baskervilles MP's story!!!: I liked the book because I like murder mysteries and if you like that kinda stuff this is a book for you! But it gets boring because you have like 14 pages a chapter basically about noghting. Also I like this book because it's got non-other than Shelock Holmes the greatest detective in book history.In the beginning it does get intresting. But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects. But he also follows them and decides if he thinks they murdered the person or not? Setting is next the setting is in London. They make it sound really scary where they are at Baskerville Hall where the heir of Sir Charles Basketville who died left to his nephew.
__label__1 " Paranormal forces in my mystery?: I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."
__label__1 The Hound: The name of my book is Hound of The Baskervilles. In this book the main character is sir Charles Baskervilles. He is a very important man then one night he dies. But he was found dead out side during his evening walk. So it is up to Sherlock Holmes to find out if this was caused to natural causes or it was rough play. Sherlock has little time to solve the mystery before chaless nephew receives his place as a rich tycoon.Idid not like this book and do not suggest this to anyone.
__label__1 Hard to read: This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle. I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.
__label__1 BAD BOOK!: this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!
__label__1 " Nothing superb about Holmes.: ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
__label__2 " Howllllllll: My grandaughter needed this book for school. Instead of trying to find one in the book stores, I had her download it on her Kindle. Fast, easy and it made me look good to my grandaughter. The purchase was a bargain at $0.99. She reviewed the book, got an A on the assignment and all is well in Houston.....Buy a Kindle...download book assignments and be a hero to your family.m"
__label__2 " great!: very good book. read it for school, but it was definitely worth it to read it. good story line that kept me interested through all the plot twists"
__label__2 " Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve: I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
__label__1 " Where's the rest?: I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing! All the poems in Alice in Wonderland as well as Through the Looking Glass and now the manuscript in Baskervilles.Either the free editions are poorly edited before release (if indeed they are proofread at all) or (more likely) Amazon is releasing an incomplete product for free in order to force us to buy one of their fancy versions. I might understand if this were an author who is still around, but with the classics I think this is unacceptable."
__label__1 " great story - but don't buy this version!!: This is one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes tales, and I was thrilled that it could be acquired so cheaply for my Kindle. However, whenever a character reads out loud from a newspaper or other document, the passage being read is missing from this Kindle edition. As such, information vital to the tale is missing. Terrible! Spend more money, and get a comprehensive (and comprehensible!) version."
__label__1 Read This First!!!!!!!!!: okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!
__label__1 Buy from a different publisher!: There are key parts of this book missing. I was so confused about the story until I realized this. Get the book from a different publisher.
__label__1 " Missing Text!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I agree with the previous reviewer. I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2. Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well. Pay the two dollars and get the complete book. Who knows how much else is missing."
__label__2 " The Hounds of the Baskervilles criticism: The story was a little uneasy at first, but the action and plot and all that good stuff kicks in. Seems to me, just one of those ""you have to get into the plot sort of books"" I'd recommend it to all, who would like to get into the Sherlock Holmes universe for the first time..."
__label__1 " Let down in literature: All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery."
__label__2 " Enhanced with music and sound effects: The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
__label__2 " chris's review: this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery."
__label__1 " Good book, bad copy.: My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story."
__label__1 " Its OK: I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
__label__2 " This is the definition of mystery genre. Doyle at his best.: This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed"
__label__1 " Useless: This edition is missing all passages in which a character is reading a letter or article, which is essential to the story. This edition is useless and needs to be removed from Amazon or corrected."
__label__1 missing content: I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download. Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
__label__1 " Missing passages: For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound. I don't know if it's just a technical glitch because I'm using the Kindle software on my Mac or there is something else going on. Doesn't seem to be much point in having a book with parts of the story missing."
__label__1 " Mising Information/Incomplete: This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
__label__1 " Missing Passages: Note: this is a review is specific for theThe Hound of the Baskervillesedition and not the book as a whole. The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book. If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone. Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version."
__label__1 " Passages missing: This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues."
__label__1 " Great story... but not on the kindle: I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy. Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars. There have to be better versions out there, though."
__label__1 Missing text.: Just wanted to agree with the other reviewers that this version is useless. I ended up getting a free version of this book from Project Gutenberg.
__label__2 " Holmes Fan Created: This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!"
__label__2 " Not so mysterious, but a great setting: Although it didn't have enough suspects to be as ""mysterious"" as some of the other Sherlock Holmes stories I've read (the ""big reveal"" of the villain was not surprising at all), this one was still a fun read.My favorite part about the book was the atmosphere. I wonder if the moor where most of the book is set is a real place. If so, I want to visit. Rocky tors, misty swamps, ancient dwellings made from stone, and the occasional large stately mansion. I'm ready to buy my plane ticket to London."
__label__1 " Missing Critical Text!: This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
__label__1 Missing parts: I concur with previous reviews. Unacceptable copy as it is mising passages - as mentioned before - which creates the most confusion from the very start. Should be removed from the Amazon catalog as it is unbecoming of this vendor. SAVE YOUR TIME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
__label__2 " The Best ""Hound"" Ever: This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
__label__1 " Don't bother downloading this copy: As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."
__label__1 " Hound of the Baskervilles: This edition is missing THE main plot of the story. Every time there is a letter or a newspaper article that is read (which anyone who reads Sherlock Holmes knows is a common device), it is skipped in the text entirely. This isn't even a good deal for free!"
__label__1 " Kindle version is missing text that is central to the story: This Kindle version is missing huge portions of text.For example, the entire manuscript read in Chapter 2 is missing.Amazon: please fix it or remove this defective version."
__label__1 " Missing passages ruin great story: This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!"
__label__1 " Defective Kindle edition--critical info missing!: If Amazon would have let me, I would have rated it *no* stars. This Kindle version of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" has a huge flaw: every time a character reads aloud from a text, that text is omitted from this edition. Here is an actual quote from my Kindle:""Dr. Mortimer [. . .] read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative ...""Considering that the omitted passages include the actual legend of the Hound, as well as the account of the death that brought the client to Holmes, this renders the story unreadable. Sadly, it looks like you get what you pay for in this instance..."
__label__1 " Defective version of great story: As others have pointed out, this version is missing critical portions that totally ruin one of the greatest mysteries in the English language. Free is generally good, but not in this case."
__label__2 " One of the All-Time Classics!: Sherlock Holmes is at his best every time you read it, and this newly-published edition is no different. The 2009 edition is well-edited, and well-presented, and the story is timeless. If you have read ""Sherlock Holmes"" in the past, it should take no convincing as to why you should read it again. If you have never read this book, then you need to purchase this today and enjoy the amazing story that the rest of us have been enjoying for years. This novel also makes a fantastic gift for those of our younger generations that have never had the pleasure of enjoying Sherlock Holmes in all of his glory.Please enjoy this book, and share it with your friends and family!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" series, and the newly-published ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
__label__1 " Not network friendly: We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit."

__label__2 " The Vedic Path: This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. My friend, whose birthday present it was, was enchanted, and used it for meditation, excercise, and to create a peaceful ambience for writing. The vocals are evocative and ethereal without being repetitive or simplistic. I would recommend."
__label__2 " Love this record book: It is simple enough that I don't feel like I'm scrapbooking (because who has time with a toddler and a newborn) but has a lot of fill in the blanks and page suggestions that keep me on track. I say suggestions because you could easily cover the prompts with more pictures and write other information on some of the pages. I have one for my daughter and my son. The color is NOT pinkish as it seems in the picture, it is a light orange gingham."
__label__2 A treasure: Thsi book is the greatest. I really covers everything baby would want to know when she gets older. My warning is that you better start writing the minute you get it or you can miss important days as you get so busy when baby is born. Try to get this item before baby is born so that you can acquaint yourself with the information you will need to enter. GET IT!!! My only regret is that one day after I bought it my sister bought me one so I could have saved that cash. My sister returned it.
__label__2 Fantastic: I recently purchased this memory book for one of my sisters who is expecting her first baby soon and she was so grateful. She loved it and now I am considering buying more for other relatives who are expecting..
__label__2 " Beware!: Readers should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as ""Emilio's Carnival."" Don't be fooled by the classy NYRB edition; the usually impeccable editors of that series have passed this ""vintage"" translation into print with nary a warning. Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems. For more information on de Zoete as a translator, see William Weaver's excellent introduction to his wonderful translation of ""Zeno's Conscience,"" which nicely dispatches de Zoete's ""The Confessions of Zeno"" to the dustheap of translation history."

__label__2 " just beautiful.: This is one of my favorite albums. The score for this film was extrodinary and the original music performed by Deborah Lurie was absolutely gorgeous.The top 5 songs of the soundtrack:1. ""It's Alright"" by Peace Out featuring Chris Logan (Black Sabbath cover)2. ""Tim's Song"" - Deborah Lurie3. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" - Postal Service4. ""Baby Hold On"" - Nina Khoury5. ""Waterfall"" - I-94This is the very best cover of ""It's Alright"" I've ever heard. Guns N Roses tried it once but this one is slightly better. It's a beautiful song and was a fantastic choice for this movie. The lyrics and overall sound of the song fit the story and pace of the music perfectly. So kudos to them for choosing to re-record it."
__label__1 " Warning for other buyers: I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap..."
__label__2 " Stunning!: I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price."
__label__1 " ""Where is the Jazz?"": I keep reading the reviews here touting this disc for it's ""jazziness"". Needless to say, I am NOT impressed with Ms. Dulfer's lame attempt to overlay her vocals to ""background jazz"" riffs. She is a much better player than this and she is now developing ""Ronnie Laws disease"" - where you believe that vocals are your bread & butter.There are a couple of fine cuts on this disc worth mentioning - specifically ""December""; ""Valdez In The Country""; and the last song ""Lost and Gone"". How ironic....this should probably also be the title of the disc!!!Hopefully, the next disc will provide a more fruitful listening experience. For unadulterated Dulfer Funk - check out ""Live in Amsterdam""....you won't be disappointed."

__label__1 Horrible Service: Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
__label__2 New Wave Review: I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. I just purchased a New Wave replacement cartridge for my 2nd year of use. I love that they remind you that it is time to replace the cartridge. I feel I am doing something good for my family with a minimum amount of money. It's worth it.
__label__2 " EXCELLENT!: My tap water is so chlorinated that my eyes would burn and my skin would itch when I got out of the shower. For a year I searched for a filter that would not just remove the chlorine odor but actually remove the chlorine! Could not find one until I discovered Enviro. I finally take showers with clean non poisonous water and gases and I'm thrilled. I also got a counter top water filter and its wonderful also since I had been purchasing bottled water before that. Just note that after a while the shower head will start to not remove the chlorine as much so you have to start thinking of replacing it but its a gradual process depending on how often the shower is used and to be expected, so I order a replacement and hold onto it until I feel its ready to change out."
__label__2 " great shower filter: It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. I would definitely recommend this filter for anyone. It is very reasonable priced considering how long each filter lasts and is very effective."
__label__2 " Good product but.....: Enviro shower chlorine filter is an excellent product. The first time I used it I saw a considerable difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I was so pleased to find out there was a replacement cartridge available for less than half the price of the whole filter. What I don't like about this product is that it leaks. Even after several attempts to reinstall it, it still leaked. Finally, we patched it up with some type of shower tape. And guess what: it still leaks.So I would give five stars for the whole filter but not for the replacement product although it does such a good job of removing chlorine."
__label__1 " Don't waste your money on this one!: While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD."
__label__2 More than just John Wayne.: It was funny to see Shirley Temple in her teens. lol I have several movies of her as a little girl and now I have one with her as a young woman.
__label__2 Trilogey: Great action movie with a plot. This completes the series of John Wayne and John Ford westerns about the U.S. Calvery. Great history lesson.
__label__2 " Western DVD: John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!I'm not a big Henry Fonda fan, but good because of JW & other cast members."
__label__2 " One of the best: Fort Apache is another wonderful example of Fords amazing directing ability! It's a pity that he is still not around to make more of these classic epics.John Wayne does a spectacular job playing Kirby York. A brilliant if somewhat bitter character, who has spent a major portion of his life fighting Indians and is therefore much more aware of the danger of fighting them as if they were civilized soldiers who obey the tactics of war.Henry Ford, as usual does an incredible acting job, as the ignorant Colonel Owen Thursday, who's pride gets him into much more trouble then it's worthI can't say that I actually ever rooted for the Indians (who did a wonderful job of appearing uncivilized) which I suppose is how it's supposed to be :-) And I was highly disappointed that Owen never made it back. Even if he WAS a disagreeable person.Fort Apache is a must see! A GREAT video!"
__label__1 Fort Apache in Blu-Ray: I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this movie. This disk was made in Mexico. Itdoes not have the original picture ration. It is only 1:49 I owned this movie on DVD beforeI purchased it in blu-ray. The DVD has retained the original movie display. I will probablytry to find someone who doesn't mind but I won't watch it.
__label__2 Western DVD: This is a good western and really well played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It carries you through a tough time in the relations of our expanding nation and the Indian nations.Chas E. Moser
__label__1 fort apache: The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
__label__2 A wonderful movie: This was the greatest movie! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!
__label__2 another oldie but goodie: First I love John Wayne movies. I remember seeing this one when I was younger and wanted it. I really like the movies where you knew the Stars (not just actors/actresses who are here today for a couple movies and who knows them after that). I also love the movies of the 40s-early 60's as they told stories that you could also use your imagination on. That is not telling/showing me every detail that belongs in the bathroom and bedroom using vulgar language as well.
__label__2 fort apache: John Wayne movies are the best.And with John Ford directing it's even more of a blockbuster.And Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple are great too.
__label__2 " Needed Tightening in the Screenplay: While I like ""Fort Apache,"" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The screenplay to ""Fort Apache"" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, ""Fort Apache"" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like ""Fort Apache"" enough to add it to my collection, as I have ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy."
__label__2 " One of the best: One of my favorite movies! Impressively sharp in blu-ray. Possibly the best of John Fords' ""cavalry trilogy"", the real star is Henry Fonda with John Wayne in a more supporting role. Doesnt appear that the other two movies in the trilogy are yet available in blu-ray, but am looking for them."
__label__2 " Here Comes the Cavalry!: This movie is one part of the ""Cavalry Trilogy"" directed by John Ford. Ya gotta collect all three to get the best of the west from the U.S. Army's perspective. Hey, it's got John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Shirley Temple (all grown up), and introduces handsome John Agar (Shirley Temple's future real-life husband). It's a great movie. If you have not seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen it before, you know what I mean."
__label__2 " FORT APACHE.: ""FORT APACHE"" JOHN WAYNE/JOHN FORD,WHAT A TEAM!! COULDN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH THIS ""PAIRING"" ALL THREE JOHN FORD CAVALRY MOVIES WERE GOOD SOLID ENTERTAINMENT, THE FORD FAMILY WERE A JOY TO WATCH!! THE BLU-RAY BLACK AND WHITE PICTURE TRANSFER IS CRISP. AND THE MONO SOUND IS EXCELLENT, GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!! RECOMMENDED. WOULD LIKE TO SEE ""SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON"" AND ""RIO GRANDE"" ON BLU-RAY, IN FACT ALL' JOHN WAYNE MOVIES ON BLU-RAY, WHY NOT? HE WAS THE GREATEST!!!!!!"
__label__2 " A Monumental Movie: Just returned from a trip out west including Monument Valley so I had to order the cavalry trilogy. This film is filled with great characters supporting Fonda & Wayne. The scenery is amazing.This is a spoiler but the ending caught me totally by suprise.If you think you know how the Duke will react in a movie you are dead wrong.Enjoy Shirley Temple, Victor McClauglen, Harry Carey etc. I enjoyed the actor who was Wayne's translator for his parlay with Cochise. I'm pretty sure he was in From Russia with Love too.A must see for Western or Wayne or Ford fans."
__label__2 " McQ: Fort Apache is one of my husband's favorite movies, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. He has a very large collection of them on VHS and now he is doing the same thing on DVDs.We both love a mystery, and westerns. If there is a little romance in them to, that is a bonus. Fort Apache is a western and full of adventure and movement. And it also has romance. A very good movie.Lu"
__label__2 Fort Apache ( Blu-Ray): Great movie and so glad to see this released to (Blu-Ray). Keep anything of John Wayne's great movies released on (blu-ray) coming as soon as they Available..
__label__1 " You gotta be kidding!: This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. I got into the second mission and thought, ""Is this it?"" From what I can tell, there is only 5 missions. I couldn't take anymore past the second mission.You can't scroll around like in SimCity, Restaurant Empire, etc. It just very one dimensional. If you are looking for a game that doesn't have all the bells and whistles, then this is the game for you."
__label__1 " Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2: I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
__label__1 " It's passable: Real Estate Tycoon is just OK. The premise is strong but the graphics and interface are clunky, the sound average, and the business functions are weak. It's a cheap game...you get what you pay for."
__label__1 " Where did the tutorials go?: I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
__label__1 ok game: Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a ok game. kinda hard to figure out.hardly any instruction manual comes with the game only to tell you how to install the game. The game is partly confusing Activision could come up with a better way to make the game more simple. I been a Fan of Trump's for awhile.The gameplay is ok once you figure out how to play.I really didnt like the game that much because it was too complicated and time crawled in the game it could of went faster.
__label__1 Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set): 5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
__label__2 " Small but very nice!: I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!"
__label__1 " Disappointingly tiny: I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. But this one is really too tiny. I couldn't tell from Amazon's picture just how small it was! There may have been an indication of the dimensions in the product description, but I missed it. Perhaps Amazon needs to be more clear about these things."
__label__2 " Lauren's 6th birthday: I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. She loves this set and I love the pictures she makes!"
__label__2 " Very Tiny Stamp Set: I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again."
__label__2 farm animal stamps: looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
__label__1 Not so great.: DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
__label__2 " Great Near Future Hard Science Fiction Anime: Fans of ""Hard"" Science Fiction tend to steer clear of Anime, due to the goofy giant robots and what not. If you are a fan of ""Hard"" Science Fiction, especially in a near-future setting, this series will really impress you.Also note, the interviews with NASA ""orbital debris specialists"" continues on volumes 2 and 3 (I haven't purchased volume 4 yet, so I can't comment)."
__label__2 " Great fit: I loved they way they fit and perform. I am an avid outdoors man. They handle the snow, ,mud and tree branches great. Would recommend this product to anyone with pets or outdoors person."
__label__2 good series: Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
__label__2 " Good DVD, but... No subtitles!: I'm a Brazilian train fan and I bought this DVD because Amazon said it was closed captioned... but not. No english subtitles for my better understanding and international customers.Positives: Image quality (DVD), DVD structure, good value.Negatives: No subtitles and too much narration... sometimes unnecessary.Obs.: A blue-ray version would be nice... with subtitles, of course!"
__label__2 " Great view of trains from behind the surface: This is a great DVD that shows how trains run, all the people it takes to make things happen, etc. Yes, the host is a little overly enthusiastic/in your face, but this series is very informative/educational. I especially liked the comparison of today's railroad operations with how the railroad routes were constructed. For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV. Each episode is about 45 minutes (8 episodes in all) so you can plug this DVD in and watch something good while you're waiting for your next favorite show to come on. Enjoy!"
__label__1 " EXTREMEly obnoxious: The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it."
__label__1 " Black?: The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. It's not much fun and the picture isn't as good as some. Not an enjoyable experience at all - and we love puzzles!"
__label__2 " Preaching as Storytelling-Par Excellence: Dr. Napier was my primary Old Testament professor and mentor at Yale Divinity School and ""Come Sweet Death"" comprised some of his imaginative chapel sermons in which he marvelously moves from the Biblical text into our cultural/social arena, applying the truths of Genesis to us. One must have some awareness of the Genesis text and scholarship of Gerhard von Rad and his American disciples, of whom Davie Napier is one; but Napier goes beyond von Rad in his interpretive skills and possesses unique insights. I use it as a resource text in my university/theological seminary courses. A must for the Biblical interpreter in a time when our sermons and commentaries are so flat and unexciting."
__label__1 " false advertisement: I ordered a black titanium barbell. Once i recieved it, not even a day later black paint was chipping off my ""titanium ring."" Obviously the ring wasn't titanium, but painted steel, manipulatinf titanium."
__label__2 My parrot loves this product.: This is the only food my 20 year old parrot will eat and it's getting harder and harder to find in my area. So glad to find it at Amazon. We're back in business!
__label__1 Every paint was dried up: I purchased this a month ago for my daughter for Christmas. She just opened them to decorate the shoes this morning and every single paint except the light blue is completely dried up inside of the tube. She is disappointed and I am annoyed.
__label__1 " smells bad: Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend"
__label__1 " Disappointed.: I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already."
__label__2 Fair Meets Sun: I'm practically an albino so I've had no luck with this type of product until now. The coloring is gradual and looks like a light base golden brown and has a nice scent. Good as it gets.
__label__1 " Oompa Loompa: I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult."
__label__2 " Fake Bake Tan: Being fair skinned, this is the perfect product to give my skin a little color without the damaging UV rays! Love it!!"
__label__2 " Clear, Concise Overview of Essential Grammar Points: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People."
__label__2 Excellent! Made college freshman English less frustrating: I use it and recommend it to many of my fellow students that are wading their way through college. Especially great for any international folk...the English language is a crazy beast.
__label__2 Real dazzler: Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. I have always been a rock fan except for Albert Lee. His music is so well done and just plain pleasant to listen to that it draws me right in. His guitar skills are as good as anyone in the buisness. His guitar is always there but never overpowering. This CD contains material I originally bought on record more years ago than I'd care to admit. It still sounds as fresh and clean as it did all those years ago. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for dazzling guitar work with a country flavor. His choice of material os first rate and the recording quality of the CD is also first rate. Buy this thing and you'll like it.
__label__2 " An Outstanding Read: An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book."
__label__2 " reviews from ""Gramophone"" and ""American Record Guide"": &#65279;1. Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song."""
__label__2 " Straight to the point: ""Seduce Me"" is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. ""Seduce Me"" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."
__label__1 " Disappointed: I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested. Believe it or not, some women have higher sex drives than their man. If you're a man needing some help with your partner, this is a good read. For a woman needing help with her man -- keep looking -- this book is not for you."
__label__2 " Seduction Scenes - A Definite Turn On: When I started reading the Seduction Scenes chapter I felt that sexual tingle of excitement...just by reading it I was turned on! I thought that part of me was dead. After being married for almost 17 years with two active boys, I find it difficult to take the time to really enjoy sex like we used to do. Lately, it has been nothing but ""quickies"" so that I can sleep! Both my husband and I are looking forward to experimenting more with the Seduction Scene Strategies and Role Playing. I was telling my girlfriend about the book and she can't wait to read it!"
__label__1 " Not Much New Here: I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources. And frankly, I think there's just nothing new here."
__label__2 Bunyan's Allegory: This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.
__label__1 Poor Quality: The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.
__label__1 " Bad ink?: Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description."
__label__2 " The book of my life: I have read this book once already and I am reading it agian right now. It is the most inspiring and motivating book that I have ever read. It seems that every time that I am loosing the sight of my spiritual path this book seems to pop up. I love it and recommend to every one, no matter if they are a spiritual person or not."
__label__2 " A Story For Everybody: This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all."
__label__2 " Very nice quality.: I have not read the book as of yet, but just wanted to let people know how substantial this book really is. It is about the size and weight of a large dictionary. While not the best for portability, it is definitely a keepsake or collector type of book. It even has it's own ribbon style bookmark built in. Can't wait to read it."
__label__1 " Dumb: basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind."
__label__1 " Puritanism at its best.: This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
__label__2 " a must-get for the battle of geonosis!: My son just got interested in collecting star wars action figures. He found this figure new in the case at a CD store in Greenville, SC. He has really enjoyed using this figure to recreate the battle of geonosis from Attack of the clones. It is also good for Dooku's final battle against Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. The only problem is the the paint on his lightsaber handle wears off easily. But it is a very good toy and an excellant addition to any star wars or action figure collection."
__label__2 " This is a good product: A good product, but costs a bit too much. I needed this and couldn't find it in any of the stores around where I live."
__label__2 Great game for toddlers: This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
__label__2 " My sick dog needed a supplement- these work !: My miniature schnauzer (11.75 years old) has congestive heart failure, and won't eat any of the prescription dog foods. So, she gets unsalted people food (ground meats, rice, oatmeal, and various baby food fruits and veggies). I wanted to be sure she got enough of the vitamins and minerals that I can't really figure out, so got these. She won't eat them (but she won't eat anything 'dog' except Charlee Bear treats), but when I crush them and put them in applesauce, she doesn't spit them out. That's a win around here these days... :/"
__label__2 " Good quality: Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn't like them too much. He ate them, but not enthusiastically."
__label__1 " Great collection - horrible quality: As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here."
__label__2 " Still great after all these years!: I played this album so much in high school I wore the ink off the cassette tape! I probably hadn't heard it for 15 years, but when I popped in the CD I was singing along word for word again right away. Not that it's earth shakingly original, but this album is so much fun to listen to, and that's what's really more important. Tight, funky musicianship, a great party album and excellent remastering. ""Lasershow"" hasn't aged well, but everything else - the classic title track, ""Free Yourself,"" ""I Spy For The FBI"" and my personal favorite ""Piece Of Your Love"" - still gets you dancing. Glad to finally have a copy of ""Stepping Stone"" again, and the other B sides - especially ""Whiplash"" and ""Shine On"" - are great too.If you're reading this review, you know this is a lost '80s classic. Don't wait any longer - get it back in your collection!"
__label__1 " This Is A Regretable Mistake: The persons responsible for the concept and production of this recording should not be let loose in a recording studio again. That Christy Baron should acquiese to such drivel is beyond comprehension. That Chesky Records would allow it to be released should be a felony.C'mon. Electronics, sampling, throat singing? Were any gimmicks spared on this production?"
__label__1 " Won't fit a 2000 gsxr600!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 has 3 bolts on the motor side, the pipe for 2001-2003 has 4 bolts, the holes don't line up. If you buy this pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 it WON'T FIT!!!!!!!"
__label__2 " Last Of The Mohicans: This entire CD is on the one. Of course ""Atomic Dog"" is the main cut, however ""Man's Best Friend"" is also a funky type of ""Knee Deep"" groove. ""Loopzilla"" is also a good song to dance to. The title cut ""Computer Games"" is as crazy as the artist. LOL. However, this album has a Funkadelic overtone. With musicians like Bootsy, Bernie, Mike, Junie, Eddie Hazel, Garry Shider and ect ect. it's worth buying. I think this is the best George Clinton album of all time. It's a R&B; Clssid and for the life of me I don't understand why it did not make the national top 40. Even the title cut went to 80 something on the charts. Go figure. George did get a award for the best video of that year.Go for ur funk"
__label__2 " Believe in Atomic Dog: Clinton's contributions to popular music are practically limitless; perhaps most importantly, he kept waving his freak flag high long after most musicians caved in to their labels' demand for conformity. Computer Games showcases his talent for squeezing archetypal beats and riffs out of his ever-changing cadre of musicians. Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour. Try to keep from playing ""Where did I hear that sampled?"" and just let the funk wash you up and away to Clinton's psychedelic, sexed-up Disneyland. Every track's a winner."
__label__2 " Loopzillacious!: ""Atomic Dog"" is so cold that after all these years party people still hurry to the dance floor on it--I've even seen't kcowboys line dancin' and doin' the Cotton-Eyed Joe on it. I guess evvy stray dawg will have his day and evvy computer playa will have a game. Thanx, Dr. Clinton, for programming this p-funky entropy."
__label__1 " Boring - Not a Good Version: I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. However, this one is my least favorite. The actress who plays Emma rather grated on my nerves and I did not enjoy her performance at all. I would not recommend this one."
__label__2 Engaging Period Piece: This Austen adaptation is a joy and a gem in spite of its low production values. Thickly British.
__label__2 delightfull miniseries with low production values: this miniseries is about a young matchmaker in regancy england who gets in involved everyones business. the performance are good but the production values are horbil and the costumes are very plain. but it is pretty good and is very faitfull to jane austens classic book.
__label__1 Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!: Anyone who knows the book knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she's between 40 to 45 years old?Isn't this actress in this 70's BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20's?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.
__label__1 " Bleh!: Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."
__label__2 You will be rewarded if you stick with it: The production values of this early 1970's BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself. The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking. Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation. Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing. The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening. In fact I would have given this five stars if the first episode was as good as the rest. Well worth spending the money to enjoy this classic adaptation of Emma.
__label__1 " Worst Emma ever: Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth."
__label__1 " Emma as a deer in headlights!: While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh! It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version."
__label__2 " Great reading and excellent story!: ""Haunted Summer"" is a great book for young teens and adults, too! It is a story of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized. I was very surprised by the circumstances, but can understand why Marilla had a choice to make. Read to see why the story is so fascinating. You will learn a lesson about yourself in the process, too."
__label__2 " Easy and fast to use: Great stuff and it works fast and easy. Not meant to refinish your kitchen, this is for Furniture only. Wear gloves and use outside or in a well ventilated area."
__label__1 Not as easy to use as stated: Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. I am very disappointed and will need to use something to bring the table to life again!
__label__1 " thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high: I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!"
__label__1 " Never again: I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. I bought everything that was recommended to use, the steel wool pads and the chemical gloves. This product ate through all the gloves we used, it disolved one of my friends acrylic fingernails, it felt like it was ice-burning our skin, made us all light-headed in a ventilated room and it barely did any improvements to my cabinets. I am concerned about us all absorbing this into our skin and any effect that may cause. I am returning all of the cans and I am VERY disappointed in this product."
__label__1 " ""O Brother"" Fans Beware!: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
__label__2 Incisive and indicting: A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Guaranteed discussion starter.
__label__1 " Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography: Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy."
__label__1 " lame photos and dreary topic: This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
__label__2 " Eerily amazing: When I first saw this book in my photo class, I thought the images were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn't read the text with all the pictures. When I bought it for myself, and got to read everything, it gave me even more of a respect for this work. Her snips of these girls lives rattle and amaze you at the same time. I love this book so much, and I think every girl/woman should look at it."
__label__2 " The product is good but the price isn't!: The product itself is very good. I bought it very frequently from amazon.com since my baby was born.But recently amazon.com raised the price from $7.49 to $10.49 which is much higher than any other grocery stores. Like in Target, the price is only $9.44!If amazon.com still maintains this highest price for this product, the customers like me will go to other stores for sure!"
__label__2 " Cool!: When Claudia baby sits for the Rodowsky family, She and Shea become friends. they are both not good at spelling. they help each other in spelling. Nut stacey almost ruins Claudia and Stacey's friendship."
__label__2 " ANOTHER GREAT CD: 4 STARS BECAUSE it sounded fine but not as great as other string quartets.I like this because the string quartet 2 uses 2 cellos.,1 violin,1 viola which was interesting.You can hear the cello more than in the other string quartets with 2 violins.This also another rare CD at a simple price."
__label__1 " Lack of Sensitivity: Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so."
__label__2 " Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family: If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
__label__2 " I can't believe it's not butter!: It's hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives ""the performance of a lifetime"", which in his case, after seeing ""Superman"", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre La�d is execrable and M�ssimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival. All in all, much ado about... butter!"
__label__1 " Last Tango In Paris: The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. The Hayes Commission version is edited for content to the point the film loses it's provocative edge, with out which is disjointed (pun intended) and boring. I've looked elsewhere for the original release version which at the time was X rated, but now all I see is the ""R"" rating which means all the good scenes are cut out!But I'll Keep looking. It's a real hot classic in it's original formRapscallion"
__label__1 " Overrated: Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."
__label__2 " Great Movie: This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work."
__label__1 Last Tango in Paris: Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
__label__1 " Don't buy it!: I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one."
__label__1 " Horrible, wretched, totally overrated: Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
__label__1 " Stupid movie: When this movie first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. The plot was silly and Brando's acting was awful."
__label__1 " Unbelievably Stupid: How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in movie history. Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time."
__label__2 " Be A Dear And Pass The Butter Please!!!: In this movie we see Malon Brando as an ageing oversexed man who embarks on a liason with a young woman played by Maria Schieder. That is about the whole plot and storyline for this movie. In this film Mr. Brando finds a very inventive use for butter which does not involve making a sandwich. He is once said to have remarked that ""acting is a bum's life"" so if you want to see a bum at work I suggest you watch this movie. I give this film 5 stars because Maria Schnieder thankfully went into movie obscurity after making his film."
__label__1 " Last Tango In Paris: I though the film was terrible. Brando mumbled in French and the plot was unrealistic. I purchased the film to see how sexualism has changed over the years, since this was touted to be the first of expicit sexual scenes."
__label__1 They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY: There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
__label__1 " BS Detector Hits ""11"": Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
__label__2 " Highly intellectal and emotional multi-plotted story.: What can one say about such a powerful story? Is it about love? Is it about irony? Is it about lust? Is it about loss? What is it all about? That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man. It's a masterpiece!"
__label__1 " trash masquerading as art: Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess."
__label__2 " Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film."
__label__2 " worth seeing: While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective."
__label__1 " A movie that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. It can be fast-forwarded to the end without anything being missed. Alas, poor Brando, we knew him well."
__label__1 " One long WTF? moment.: We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
__label__2 " Classic Marlon Brando Movie.....: I read the mixed reviews for this movie, so I had to comment. This movie is classic. The storyline may offend some people, but come on. Life is rocky, and believe me, going over the rocks with Marlon Brando would be a pleasure. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1972, and I still enjoy it today in 2010. Tango anyone??"
__label__1 " Unappealing and unnecessarily perverted: I went into this film thinking that I would see an unorthodox film involving sex. I've seen many films that could fit this description such as ""Happiness"" by Todd Solondz and ""Romance"" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating."
__label__1 " nothing of value: It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered ""art"" and ""decent"". To me, it was just a monumental waste of time, like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci's work."
__label__1 " Can't be that great.: I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it."
__label__1 " Couldn't wait for it to be over!: I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back."
__label__1 " This is a great film?: Let me get this straight. The story starts with a man and a woman, strangers looking at vacant apartment. They walk around a bit, say a few words, then he grabs her and they go to it. Nothing is given to justify this, no romance, no chemistry, no flirting, not even lustful looks. It is as if two people just ran into each other on the street and went straight at it. This is great film making? On what planet?"
__label__1 " Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time: Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie."
__label__1 A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY: This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.
__label__2 " Unforgettable: Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
__label__1 " Twisted and boring: The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters. Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I didn't like but couldn't leave. Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film."
__label__1 " Extremely disappointing: This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time."
__label__2 " 3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago."
__label__1 Materpiece that needs an overhall: faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
__label__1 " Depressing, Despicable and Down-right Disgusting: Marlon Brando was one of the most overrated actors of all time. Anyone who knows about his personal life and still thinks he was a respectable person should have their head examined. The fact that he was comfortable with this awful role says enough about the kind of man he was. Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough. The story and soundtrack couldn't even come close to saving this trash either."
__label__1 " Quite possibly the worst movie in cinematic history: Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. On the DVD case, a reviewer squeals: ""The most erotically powerful movie ever made!"" Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."
__label__1 " what's the big deal?: This has to be the most overrated movie ever made. Even by 1970's standards, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Marlon Brando is just his usual brooding self. The girl is extremely beautiful, but even if she was naked through the entire movie, I cannot understand why anyone considers this a cinema masterpiece."
__label__2 " Great bindings, good commentaries: We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; Coriolanus"
__label__1 " Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes: I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle."
__label__2 " Great composition: Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but reading the real, written work is another world. It is a different way to think of the story you know. I bought this compilation to read all of Shakespeare's works and it is truly great. One thing I'd advise is that you know how to read scripts. This book is written as Shakespeare wrote his plays. Though, every work is prefaced with the characters names and role they play, it can still be a bit difficult to get through because of the way it's written.Jul. Then, window let day in and let life out.Rom.Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.[descendsJul.Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!It can become a bit much.I gave it four stars because it has such small font: around 8 or 9 px font you'd find on MS word."
__label__2 " An heirloom for every American: As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls. Beautifully assembled, this keepsake will instill pride in its citizenry. Making selections from myriad possibilities must have been a dire undertaking, but those represented indicate a fair cross-section of time and geography. An excellent tribute to a worthy source!"
__label__1 " Not a good value for the price: Given the price of this book, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Too little information for a hardcover book that supposed to be a guide for manufacturers on how to implement TOC."
__label__2 " Funk Music and Sufism: The music of Mercan Dede, or with his other name DJ Alan Arkin, is taking us to a travel in the land of Sufism. I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song ""Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi"", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. ""Walking on the Red Sea"", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do."
__label__2 " Exciting Action and Adventure: I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. It's been years since I read a historical novel that was so well written. But do yourself a favor, read Into the Wilderness first. I found myself wondering so much about references to things that happened in the first book that I just had to search for it to read. And I wasn't disappointed. But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels. It's like Elizabeth can never catch a break. I am now eagerly awaiting the paperback printing of Lake in The Clouds. I plan to pass these books on as a set, to anyone I know who is into historical novels."
__label__2 " Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!: This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters. (A deeper view) I kept turning the pages wanting more, and was rewarded. When all is said and done with this series, this book in paticular will have a special place with me. It's a delight!"
__label__1 " Into the Wilderness It's NOT: I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."
__label__2 Great series: It can be a little slow at times but I have enjoyed this series and fallen in love with many of the characters. I would recommend.
__label__2 " Captiating!: Cannot put it down, just like the rest of the series. Moments of emotion, suspense, happiness and sadness. The story just gets better and better."
__label__2 " On a trip: The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other."
__label__2 " Dawn on a Distant Shore: I had read Donati's series of six Wilderness books and really liked them so I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she had read the first one and liked it. They are long books but never boring. I thought the book would be a larger size, as the soft cover ""Into the Wilderness"" had a bigger cover with a little larger print but the book came quickly, was reasonably priced, and my daughter is happy to receive it. Donati is a really good writer. I only discovered her this year. - Fran"
__label__2 " DDS...a roller coaster ride!: This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!"
__label__2 " Dawn on a Distant Shore: I found ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland. It continued with the lifes of the Bonner family and close friends and brought back some characters from the past that added more intrigue. I read through it quickly because I couldn't put it down. Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean."
__label__2 " Lovely Romance: The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. I loved following the budding romance."
__label__1 " Not Worth My Time: I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me."
__label__2 " A Strong 4.5 Stars: This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book."
__label__1 " Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters."
__label__1 " I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.: I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"
__label__1 " Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I ""skimmed"" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."
__label__1 " Yawn on Distant Shore.....: I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was."
__label__1 " The story falls over: The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place."
__label__1 Yawn.: I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!
__label__1 Disappointed: Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
__label__1 " Not as good as her other books: I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better."
__label__2 " Much Better than the first: This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!"
__label__1 " Good, but I expected more: After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license."
__label__2 " An excellent read!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate ""fluff"", then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading."
__label__1 " Very disappointing!!!: I was so thrilled with vol. 1 ""Into the Wilderness"" that I ordered the second volume from the library before investing money into a hardcover version. I'm glad I didn't buy one as it was the most disappointing book since I read Kate Morton.""Into the Wilderness"" was so promising and I really wonder how the sequel can be so shallow?This whole journey from Montr�al, Canada, to Dumfries, Scotland, used up close to 300 pages in the book and when Nathaniel and Elizabeth are finally in Scotland, things don't get any more interesting.What a boring read!Zero stars was not possible, so I have to give it 1 star :(.I hope ""Lake in the Clouds"" will be better, but if it's only about Hannah, I doubt I will read it.I was hoping to read more about Nathaniel and Elizabeth."
__label__2 " review: I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
__label__2 " A devoted reader!!: When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!!!"
__label__1 " dawn on a distant shore: Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."
__label__1 " A boring disappointment!: Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money."
__label__1 " Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read ""Into the Wilderness"" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author."
__label__1 " BORING!: Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon."
__label__2 Nice value tent: Easy set up overall. Wish the bottom was lined with tarp instead of nylon.Good roomy ceiling. Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.
__label__2 " Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
__label__2 " perfect campground tent: You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."
__label__2 Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
__label__1 " Beware - Product is not as pictured: While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."
__label__2 " In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart."
__label__2 " If only real women were like this . . .: _The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this. But, one can always hope that there are still a few out there."
__label__1 over-rated!: poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
__label__1 " Hard to feel anything for the characters: This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience."
__label__2 " Amazing: I love horror/thriller movies but rarely ever get frightened from them. This movie was great. I was genuinely scared. I think that this movie has the best ""monsters"" in a long time. Definitely getting it for my dvd collection."
__label__2 Awesome: This is probably the most effective horror movie I have ever seen. The all female cast does a phenomenal job of keeping the audiences attention (and no there is no nudity). Shows what a talented director and cast can do with little money and a good story. Has more scares and is more entertaining than the majority of horror that is released in theatres.
__label__2 TRULY SCARY - Blu-ray Perfection!: I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!
__label__1 " A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out."
__label__1 " Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel?: If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did."
__label__1 " boring. boring. and....yes boring.: I don't know what type of movies these people watch but this movie was NOT scary, it had NO suspense, and was just plain boring. I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring."
__label__1 " Kind of lame, as most horror movies are: I'm not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch ""The Descent"" with her, and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy ""The Descent"" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."
__label__1 " Boring movie with good Blu-ray features: THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in ""behind the scenes"" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes. I bought it for ten bucks at Wal-mart and I guess it was worth that for the cool features on the Blu-ray but I sure feel ugly and bored after watching it all."
__label__1 " It could have been really good...but: Some things were good, but more were bad, here's a run down of the positive and the negative:(+)side:1.the setting of an underground cave2.couple moments that make you jump3.great concept(-)side:1.story2.cast3.troll creatures4.tried to take itself too seriously"
__label__1 " ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!: Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
__label__1 " The Descent?: Almost a full hour into this movie before you see what the movie is even supposed to be about. It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of ""horror"" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like ""Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles"". If your going to advertise a movie as ""scary"" and ""horror"" than MAKE IT LIKE ONE. This is just a chick flick with some ""BOO!s"" tossed in towards the end, stay away from this failed flick."
__label__2 " Chicks with Accents in America!: This movie is a little dated. I am sure it scared the every loving be-jesus out of folks when it came out. That said, its still scary! It will keep your interest thats for sure. Hey- we are talking 6 foxy chicks going into a cave to crawl around. What guys interest does that not hold? Chicks will enjoy the female choas of the group. There are a couple of scenes that will unsettle even the most stone faced horror show movie goer. Oh- the funny thing about this movie is that all the chicks have British accents. Not sure how this happens, but it adds to the charm of these chicks crawling around the cave. ""Is anyone injured?"", vs (American)""Are you OK?"". Its worth buying, and seeing a couple a times."
__label__2 " 3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Without question the best horror film to come out in the last decade (not that it's had much competition), The Descent takes a little time to develop an interesting (and all female) group of friends before plunging them into a situation that would be terrifying enough even if there weren't creatures to worry about; if you like horror and haven't seen this film then you should be ashamed.Note: Please watch the unrated version/Director's cut for a much better ending"
__label__2 " A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this. Excellent horror adventure."
__label__1 " Another one bites the dust..: Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
__label__1 " Bad!: The first DVD I received had no disc! The second one I received was packaged fine but halfway through the movie it had static, skipped, etc. Very poor quality."
__label__1 " THIS SUCKS: THIS IS THE STUPIDIEST MOVIE EVER MADE. AND THOSE WHO SAY IT IS A GREAT MOVIE SHOULD HAVE THEIR HEADS EXAMINE. A GANG OF BORED WOMEN WITH NOTHING TO DO WIT THEIR LIVES GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO BE EATEN BY SOME UNDERGROUND ALBINO, BLIND CREATURES THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM.ONE, FOR WONEN WITH EDUCATION ( DOCTORS, LAWYERS,ETC.)

DUH.....IT STOLE STORY-LINES FROM GOOD HORROR MOVIES LIKEW ALIEN FOR INSTANCEIF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS TO THIS MOVIE; BELIEVE, I WOULD"
__label__1 DUMB!: This movie is a bunch of nonsense. A group of girls (rolls eyes) explores a cave in the U.S.A. (rolls eyes again) with aliens living in it (rolls eyes a third time). DUMB. I can not believe all the good reviews I have read. They must all be from the production staff.
__label__1 " horror for ten year olds: Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about."
__label__1 LOUSY: This movie was about an inch of me gonging it. It was like I was in the cave watching it. I plan to sell it to Blockbuster because it is not worthy to be in my collection.The best part was the end.
__label__1 " Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and: Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and...."
__label__1 " FAIR: THE MOVIE FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. I KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOU TO KNOW THE CHARCTERS IN THE BEGINNING. THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DID KNOW ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK THE CHARCTERS WERE STRONG ENOUGH. MAYBE THEY NEEDED STRONGER ACTRESSES LIKE SIGOURNY WEAVER, LINDA HAMILTON EVEN ANGELA BASSET. BUT THE MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS. IT'S GOOD TO WATCH, AND IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON WHEN YOU HAVE MOVIE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS. :-)"
__label__1 descent into stupidity: I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
__label__1 " SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!: I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"
__label__1 " Disappointing hollywood formula ending: Buyer beware. This is a version with a feel good hollywood formula ending. It is not the original, it was redone to give the US viewers a somewhat happy and typical USA horror ending / resolution, (pretty symbolic of our countries state I would say). Get the European version. I bought this thing w/o realizing they redid it, now I am buying the original---"
__label__1 " Don't waste your time...: What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?"
__label__2 " I never get scared, BUT!!!: I thought that The Ring was funny when that girl came out of the TV. I still get a kick out of how ""not scary"" that was. The Grudge made me cackle with joy when the hairy ghost girl emerged, how funny! Nothing seem to scare me in theatre anymore, except for this movie. I didnt really know what it was about when I saw it, and I atually got goose bumps. It combines good acting with many types of horror. The horror of being trapped in a cave system and then finding out you are not alone in there! There are times when you feel your heart pace quicken because of the tight situations. Basically, just watch it and dont watch it alone! Make sure its dark and enjoy!"
__label__2 " good movie: I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies."
__label__2 " good movie: It is worth to watch, good story, scaring but also attractive, should it is very good for friends' gathering, all ppl watch together"
__label__2 good: Its a great movie for jumps and scares and the story is not that bad. I have a high end system and the audio is pretty awesome as it helps convey the Scary elements. The picture is good on my HD TV but not the best I've seen. Its a great movie to pop on a rainy night especially enjoyed on a good surround sound system!
__label__2 " Terrorific Extreme Adventuring: When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure."
__label__2 good all the way thru: Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
__label__2 " Better than expected.: Not bad! Worth the watch! The monsters or whatever were a little weird but oh well, still some scary stuff."
__label__2 I'm not going spelunking!: If ever a movie made me want to stay out of dark caves this one is it. Love the creepy dark surprises.
__label__2 " A good flick: This is a good modern take on a wonderful H.P. Lovecraft story. The claustrophobic element is great, the cinematography is good and the story keeps you entertained."
__label__2 Stay Far Away from Caves: Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
__label__1 Not bad for a budget movie: I thought they did a good job with makeup in the movie but the script and the way it was directed was not typical for a movie of this type. Made it feel more budget.
__label__2 " What a movie....: This movie was very very good, but confusing at the end. It is a great scare, most will enjoy the movie. Be ready for a fright night! Enjoy!"
__label__1 " Waste of Time: READ THE BOOK!!! This is just a horribly pieced together slasher film. The book is a really good read, don't see this unless you're trying to scare your eight ear old sibling."
__label__2 " The Descent: This is quite simply one of the best horror movies ever made. And this comes from a person who watches almost nothing but horror every day. Never has a movie been so bleak since ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". Neil Marshall first made his mark on ""Dog Soldiers"", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing. This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite, ever made."
__label__2 " The Descent.: A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."
__label__2 " The Descent: This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much."
__label__2 " WOW Great movie!!: I could just say ""WOW"" and leave it at that! If you like scary movies, movies with lots of action, and movies that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD......well, then buy this movie!! It has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies!!"
__label__1 " Descent Review: I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also."
__label__1 " No turkey just a STINKER: Wow- i remember renting this when it first came out, and probably would have both excited and scared me if i was 12, ok maybe 13 or even 14. Beyond predictable, and the scary stuff was just smoke and mirrors to me. Really a waste of time as I have seen better B plots. Filmography was decent but that was about it"
__label__1 BORED AT ALL...: I SAW THE MOVIE BUT IT'S BORED AT ALL. ALSO IT'S NOT ENJOYMENT. THE CREATURE WAS STRANGE AND DISGUSTING. I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD-LOOKINGBUT IT WAS NOT. ANYWAY THIS MOVIE WAS A FAILURE.
__label__1 " disappointing: I didn't find the Descent to be a very interesting film. It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere."
__label__1 " one star and one jump: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
__label__1 " One of the worse horror films ever made.: Just finished watching this movie and the best thing about it is it finally ended.Slow, boring, and extremely gory with uninteresting characters tied to a script filled with cliches. That about does it except if you're having trouble sleeping do watch it since it's a wonderful cure for insomnia."
__label__1 " Trash...utter trash: After getting about five minutes into this movie, I was wondering why I should care. I was wondering the same thing at fifteen minutes, half an hour, an hour, and all the way through the end.Frankly, I was bored, I thought the suspense was completely transparent, the characters unbelievable, and the acting mediocre at best.Complete waste of time. Watch paint dry instead. You'll thank yourself."
__label__1 HORRIBLE. PLAIN HORRIBLE....: I have nothing good to say about this movie as it made no sense at all execpt that the female's British accents were cool.
__label__1 " Well, that was terrible...: I'm disapointed that I'm never getting back the 99 minutes of my life I wasted on watching ""The Descent."" It's just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, ""Feast"" (horror/sci fi). This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN'T watch. VERY predictable...tried working off of sheer gore...and when that didn't work...well...I was kind of cheering for them all to die. ;-)The best part about this movie:I didn't pay to rent it, my sister did! Hahahaha...P.S. PICK SOMETHING ELSE...ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS IS BETTER!"
__label__1 Desucked: If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
__label__1 " Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut."
__label__2 " Pretty creepy: I had hopes for this one and it delivered. I liked how I was never sure what to expect, even though some elements were typical of suspenseful/horror movies. It was gory enough to make me cringe, and creative in that it isn't an unbeatable super-monster based tale. I like the ending, and would like to see the alternate, as well. Really good stuff!"
__label__2 " Intense: Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely ""The Descent 2,"" will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!"
__label__2 " Take ""The Descent"" into a realm of pure terror!: If you are tired of those lame, ineffective horror movies that have been advertised to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you to death, take a look at ""The Descent"" for a fresh new look on this view.This movie WILL terrify you beyond all belief. You will find yourself just as scared as the victims in this movie. You will be clenching onto the nearest item in anticipation for what is going to happen next. Because, trust me, you really have no idea what will happen next.I found myself practically leaping out of my seat in terror. And, trust me everyone, that RARELY happens. I go through most movies with a whatever attitude and don't show any fear. I make it through movies like The Exorcist without breaking a sweat. However, this movie had me wondering what was going to happen and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time.Once again, IF you want that horror film that will not let you down in the slightest bit, pick up ""The Descent"" today."
__label__2 " a veritable masterpiece: neil marshal's The descent"" is a great movie.the outline is as follows.six girlfriends go caving only to find out they are not alone in the cave.what follows is a fast paced adrenaline fueled thrill ride that grabs you by the throat and won't let go.there are many scary moments in the film.there is a nice buildup of suspense before the creatures are revealed, and once they are, they are terrifying.the acting is good and there characters are well developed in the early stages of the film(before the caving scenes).you may be out of breath before this one ends.if you get scared easy, you may want to watch this movie with someone or you might not get through it,as it is intense.i liked the twist ending, which sets up nicely for a sequal.i saw the britsh version, in which the ending apparrently differs from the north american.i can't wait to check out the north american version to compare.you have to check out this movie. 5* out of 5"
__label__2 " Finally, a decent horror movie: This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. It's about time they made a horror movie with strong female leads that doesn't degrade them or use them as eye candy dangled in front of a sadistic killer.This movie had a lot of layers to its characters and the creatures were freaking scary!"
__label__2 " Above grade: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded."
__label__1 " Dark and Confusing: I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two."
__label__1 " Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!"
__label__2 " The difference between unrated and regular version: First of all let me say i really enjoyed this movie. Not like a regular slasher. Its very good. I actually seen it at the show. Now the main difference that no one has listed out of all these reviews is, just the ending. I didnt see any more gore than was at show. Something unrated doesnt always mean extra gore or sex. Anyway just the ending is different than one that was seen in US theatres. I wont spoil ending for you if you havent seen, but most know from youtube what its really suppose to be. Anyway pick this movie up and add it to your collection. Its a keeper!"
__label__2 " Creepy Cave Trips Are Never a Good Idea: This movie is scary. This group of women thinks it is fun to go on annual adventure trips. I prefer a nice hotel on the beach, but creepy crawly caves sound better to them. You really get to know the characters and care about them and the things they have been through. It is their trip to the caves and what they go through there that will terrify you. If you are claustrophobic, you will definitely be freaked out by this movie. I love a good scary movie, which may be why I am an insomniac, and this movie is well written and acted and will give you the creeps. I highly recommend it. Power Path to Love"
__label__2 " Great Horror movie!: I love horror movies. Unfortunatly, it's hard for me to find any that actually scare me. ""The descent"", however, does a fantastic job. I popped it into my DVD player with the average expectations of a ""horror"" movie set in caves with girls as the protagonists. About halfway in though, when the ""monsters"" finally showed up, (with a very creepy introductory view from down a tunnel) I was pressed into my couch as far as I could go, arms around knees, and intently watching every moment of the movie.I have never squealed like a girl while watching a horror movie, but ""The Descent"" evoked several from me, and I was thankful to be watching it without witnesses!I highly recommend ""The Descent"" to anyone seeking a scary movie!"
__label__2 " Amazing.: 2006 has been packed with PG-13 horror films, lots of them. Then are the gore flicks (TCM the beginning), and other stuff. Finally, a good horror movie comes out in august: THE DESCENT, a British horror film with a good twist.STORY: One year after a car accedent, 6 women reunite in a cabin in the Appilachian mountains to Go on a caving expedition. When they arrive at the cave, the descent into the cave begins, and their exit is blocked. They keep praying and pushing, hoping for another exit, but a bunch of deadly creatures attack...THOUGHTS: THis is a cool movie. Good music, great s/fx, and great lighting, I thought it was cool that the only light was natural.SO see this film!"
__label__2 " The Descent Blu-ray Review: I already have this movie on DVD, but like it so much that I ordered it on Blu-ray too. I am very impressed with the quality of the HD. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an original horror flick! I also continue to be impressed with Amazon's excellent service and quality products."
__label__2 " Well cast, intense, and suprisingly unconventional: This movie could have easily been an inane, repititious, piece of garbage. Just cast one, or more, of US Weekly/STAR/TMZ's latest darlings. Let 'em stumble through the film with mediocre acting skills- but perfect hair and make up! The pay off? Why those opening weekend box office returns of course!Instead, ""The Descent"" takes the road less traveled, no pun intended. The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well. Altruistic and nurturing one minute, egomaniacal and totally aloof the next.The film exploits a common phobia; being trapped, enclosed places, etc., by showing us the most extreme and terrifying scenario. And it works! This movie is chillingly intense."
__label__1 " Blows!!!: As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money."
__label__1 " CAVE-DWELLING SLASHER FLICK: My expectations were very high when I bought this DVD. The first 45 minutes of the movie were a little slow, but seemed to be building up some momentum. The first 15 minutes of cave diving with the bush league spilunkers was OK!. After that, the flick just turned into another slasher movie in a cave. The darkness added little and the plastic vampires were a little too stupid to watch. Nothing more than a slashers flick! What a total disappointment."
__label__1 " Horrible film.: This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
__label__1 " BOOOOOORRRING!!!!: Until now, there was some debate aboutPlan 9 from Outer Spacebeing the worst movie ever made. Well, the debate is over...The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)wins that prize hands down! There's definitely something wrong with a movie when you find yourself rooting for the monsters more than the victims. And how come all the monsters look like mindless male brutes? Hmmm...Thank goodnes for the FAST FORWARD button, and even more thanks for the STOP button. Now, if I can just find the FORGET button!"
__label__1 " overated and robbed: Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. Perhaps its me, I am retard! but I felt I was robbed of time. I found it lacked story, and the moral of the story was odd. ok, in the end, the main character dreamed it all--did she? The Journey to the Centre of the Earth had much more imagination and charm by the rope length!"
__label__1 " This is a joke!!: I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Needless to say once I started watching it, I was bored for the first hour. Then these ridiculous looking monsters appear out of nowhere.ABSOLUTELY BORING, HARD TO SEE, and STUPID. WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie."
__label__1 " Don't Waste Your Time: I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time."
__label__1 " It COULD have been a great movie . . ..: Okay. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere was suitably claustrophobic. The background music fit the feel of the movie. The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the ""heroine"". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . .."
__label__2 " A great follow up to Dog Soldiers: The Descent has everything you could want in a horror film. The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien. While I enjoyed Dog Soldiers quite a bit, The Descent is a film worthy of my horror DVD collection."
__label__2 " Dark and Claustrophobic Horror: The Descent is a horror movie that develops a plot that's original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. I had never seen these actresses, who here play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version)."
__label__2 " Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!: Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book."
__label__2 " Very Entertaining Movie: I watched the China Doll movie DVD that I received from Amazon.com and thought it was very entertaining movie. The movie builds up the relationship between Capt. Brandon (Victor Mature) and Shu Jin (Li Li Hua) which leads to their marriage and having a little baby. It is sad at the end as both Shu Jin and Capt. Brandon are both killed, but it was nice to see the daughter 14 years later being met at Los Angeles Airport by Capt. Brandon's old crew. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies that end up being very heartwarming."
__label__2 " Wonderful Movie: I have not seen this movie since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon, I bought it straight away. On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy."
__label__2 " About China Doll: This is a movie that i've wanted for over 20 yrs. Amazon.com is my hero!!!! This movie made me cry when i watched it after i had seen it with my dad, who died in 1990. This is a movie that makes me feel closer to him."
__label__1 " Too Old: I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling."
__label__1 " Terrible! Beyound-use date: Lipstick that arrived is so old, it even smells worse then my granny's oldest lipstick which she takes out from the tube with a match!I had to throw it away...."
__label__2 " Borror and Delong's Study of Insects: Great price...well over half off of the university's bookstore. Only black and white pictures and illustrations, but very thorough coverage of entomology."
__label__2 REVIEW - Borror & DeLong: This is a keystone book that should be in every entomologist's library next to Chapman's The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano's The Science of Entomology.

__label__1 " Only a music producer can like this.: Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation."
__label__1 " beware: The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant."

__label__1 " oh my goodness!: If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor."
__label__2 " The dummy ""FATS"" is hysterical!!!!: ALL I can really say about the movie is that the puppet steals the show. It really didn't matter how weak the story was because the puppet's comments made the show."
__label__1 " Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
__label__1 " More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony: Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
__label__2 " Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Movie!: forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as ""Fats"", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor."
__label__2 " MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!: Though the movie was frightening enough, it wasn't what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. What I witnessed was the thing that STILL freaks me out when I think about it. The Magic commercial. All it was was Fats the dummy reciting a demonic poem. I can still say the poem to this day. I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again."
__label__2 " Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated: FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since. Still, it has left a lasting , unavoidable impression upon me. I have both dreaded and longed to see it again. Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible."
__label__2 " Magic: If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. It is a bit ""off"" but it keeps you watching. A very different movie. Saw this years ago and remembered it. It never comes on cable. I think it is worth a look."
__label__2 " Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film.: I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing."
__label__2 " A ventriloquists nightmare: Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist ""Corky"" and his dummy ""fats"" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in ""Magic"". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now."
__label__1 " great movie massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."
__label__2 " Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers: ""Magic"" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with ""The Bunker"" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles."
__label__1 " The Only Dummy Is The Writer: ""Magic"" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book."
__label__2 " ""He's NO Dummy. . ."": Viewing ""Magic"" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to ""watch this actor."" I saw ""Magic"" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a ""squeeze box"" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role."
__label__2 " Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing."
__label__2 " A truly great horror movie: I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."
__label__2 " Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it."
__label__2 " classic: i got this for my dad. it is super creepy and worth a watch, but don't watch it in the dark."
__label__2 Psychological thriller!: This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
__label__2 A little more money than what I expected to spend on in.: This is a good movie. My husband enjoyed it. I wasn't too impressed with the price of the movie since it was an older film.
__label__1 " ""The Silence of the Dummies"": This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! ""Fats"" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see ""Fats"", but during some of the more ""romantic "" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real ""vent"" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit ""outside"" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano"
__label__1 " Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
__label__1 " Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters."
__label__2 " A revelation of life in small town America in early 1900s: Though a scholarly biography, the book reveals much more about life in a small mid-west America town at the turn of the century than many other biographies or novels. Well worth reading for an insight into ""news"" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon."
__label__2 " Great biography of a very interesting journalist: This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating read. The role of the small-town newspaper publisher carried much of the moral weight of towns like Lamar, Missouri, during the first half of the twentieth century before the era of instant news carried by radio and television changed everything. The author does a fine job of demonstrating the role in both politics and society that newspaper publishers played during this era. Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri. In addition, he was a character that continues to shape the nature of the small town where he published; his legacy newspaper still is in publication."
__label__1 " Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century."

__label__2 " Beautiful Pen and Fast Delivery.: The pen was shipped promptly. This is the classic Montblanc pen that everyone raves about. It is Black in color with Golden Trim. It holds it's own and I am thankful to my parents to gift this to me as a Graduation Present. Someday I plan on buying more of these pens from Amazon.The vendors at Amazon are amazing. I have been a long time shopper at Amazon, mostly pens and electronics. However this pen was gifted to me by my mom and she has nothing but good things to say. I on my part love this pen."
